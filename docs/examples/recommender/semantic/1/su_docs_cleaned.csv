A developer is rarely concerned with how many documents there are on a knowledge base. If a search for ""analytics"" does not return API documentation on the first page, then the results are irrelevant to him. On the contrary, admins tends to be more interested in reports. If a search engine cannot navigate an admin to reports documentation, then its results are irrelevant to the admin. Auto Tuning helps admin cater both the developer and the admin simultaneously. Auto Tuning transforms SearchUnify into a context-aware search engine that does much more than connecting a search query with documents. It takes into account a user's profile, search history, permissions, and several other factors to return results that more unique and relevant at the same time. An admin can enhance user experience significantly using Auto Tuning's four features: Auto Boosting, Enable Auto Spell Correcter, Facet Interpreter, and Rich Snippets. How Auto Tuning Works Auto Tuning keeps a record of user activity and analyzes the data thus collected to identify patterns. The patterns are then used to change the order of search results for individual users based on their activity. The diagram captures user journey. User 1 creates four sessions whose data is stored and analyzed in SearchUnify's machine learning engine. The engine compares User 1's activities with other searchers to find behavioral similarity. Once a threshold for behavioral similarity is reached, SearchUnify starts personalizing results. In the figure, User 1 gets more relevant results in the fifth session. Based on the analysis of the first four sessions, SearchUnify tries to deliver more relevant results. Then in a sixth session, the activities of the first five sessions are considered. And it goes on and on. The activities' of User 1 have no impact on the results of User 2 unless both happen to have similar search journeys. Search results of User 2 are personalized based on the data processed from his own activity. Features Enable Auto Boosting. Machine learning kicks in when Auto Tuning is turned on. Toggle Enable Auto Tuning to the right to get started. Enable Auto Spell Corrector. Teach the terms specific to your business to SearchUnify by connecting it with a content source. If SearchUnify is aware of your organizational terminology (which can be markedly unique), it will recognize those terms in search queries and never show incorrect suggestions. For example, ""Salesforce"" will never be corrected to ""sales force."" Enable Facet Interpreter. Improve search experience by automatically applying filters. When turned on and connected with a content source, SearchUnify improves user experience by applying filters behind the scenes each time a search query matches a facet value. For example, a search for ""Mark Twain"" on an online bookshop will fetch five extra results if ""Mark Twain"" is also a filter value in the Authors filter. Enable Rich Snippets. Provide answers to how-to kind of queries right on the search page by extracting lists or steps from relevant articles. Toggle Enable Rich Snippets to turn on. No other configuration is required."
1,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Search-Tuning/Enable-Facet-Interpreter.htm,Enable Facet Interpreter,"Enable Facet Interpreter Counterintuitive although it may sound, you can actually get relevant results faster by narrowing the search scope. A search for ""API"" on the SearchUnify Docs website produces 78 results, many of which might be of little use to a developer looking for a list of endpoints or documentation on what is a valid argument in a POST call. By checking the facet Developer Guides, the programmer can obtain fewer but highly targeted results. Here's a comparison. Facets are a useful weapon in a searcher's toolkit if they use them. Many users don't. With Enable Facet Interpreter, admins can enable users to view faceted search results even when users themselves don't explicitly check a facet value. As the rest of the article explains, the approach has many pros and no downside. How Enable Facet Interpreter Works Enable Facet Interpreter compares search queries with facet values. In Figure 2, a user searches ""jira"", which also happens to be a facet value in Topic. If Enable Facet Interpreter is turned on and configured for the content type Topic, then the searcher will find up to five more results on the first search results page. The extra results are those which the user would have gotten by checking the facet value ""jira."" Figure 2. Impact on User Experience More and relevant results. Instead of replacing regular results with faceted results, Enable Facet Interpreter provides as many as five extra faceted results on the first search results page. As choice increases, so does user satisfaction. Control. Admins can configure which facet values to recognize from search queries. On a search client with three filters: Tags, Date, and Author Name, an admin can set up Enable Facet Interpreter in such a way that only author names are detected as facet values from search queries. Any matches with tags and dates are ignored. Turn On Enable Facet Interpreter Select a search client where auto boosting will be applied. To auto-pick a search client each time you navigate to Search Tuning, click to bookmark it. Toggle Enable Facet Interpreter to turn it on. Now, select content fields to double as facets. For instance, if you want to use authors as facets and all author names are stored in a content field, then use to open a window and specify that content field. Click to launch a window where you can select content sources. Select the content source, content type, and content fields and click Add. Click after you are done. Click Train Facet Interpreter. Important For Enable Facet Interpreter to work, an admin has to both toggle the feature on and specify the content fields that will be recognized as valid filters."
2,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Search-Tuning/Enable-Rich-Snippets.htm,Enable Rich Snippets,"Enable Rich Snippets and Rich Cards Rich Snippets and Rich Cards enrich user experience when an end-user wants definitions, tips from instructional articles, images, and videos right on the search results page. It is capable of extracting four kinds of data from HTML pages: Facets. Short answers consisting of a word or an entire sentence. Example: For the query [searchunify mamba '21 release date], Facets provides the date ""October 29, 2020"". Instructions. Ordered (ol) and bullet (ul) lists. This facet is triggered by questions starting with ""How to."" Example: In response [to how to setup virtual agent in searchunify], Instructions tells you how to start. Images. Pictures where they are relevant and exist. PNG, JPEG, JPG, and other major formats are supported. Example: Images responds with three pictures in answer to the search query [searchunify apps]. Videos. Tutorial, demonstration, and other videos where they exist and are relevant. MP4, HTML5, and other major formats are supported. Example: For the query [virtual agent], you can see a video right inside a rich snippet. Turn on Enable Rich Snippets To activate this feature on a search client, turn on Enable Rich Snippets from Auto Tuning in Search Tuning. Before turning on Enable Rich Snippets, ensure that you have the correct search client in Select Search Client. Select a search client where auto boosting will be applied. To auto-pick a search client each time you navigate to Search Tuning, click to bookmark it. Toggle Enable Rich Snippets to the right to turn it on. To turn off rich snippets, select a search client and toggle Enable Rich Snippets to the left. Best Practices for Writers Writers can arrange their content to ease extraction and display. Lists Convey essential information in the first 3-4 points Keep each bullet point to a maximum of 80 characters Avoid using MadCap Flare snippets Cover the main points in the first list (Applies when there are more than one lists on a page) Use <ol> and <ul> tags Images Place images near the main heading (H1) Use matching file names (image_name.png) and alt attributes Use similar image titles and alt attributes Write page titles and meta descriptions Compress images using scrset and src attributes Crawl the images XML sitemap as well Related Configure a Knowledge Graph"
3,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Search-Tuning/Intent-Tuning.htm,Intent Tuning,"Intent Tuning If you have limited keywords to boost, say 50, Keyword Boosting can help you out. But what if you have to handle boosting for 5000 keywords and synonyms? Intent tuning saves the day in such scenarios as it allows you to put a custom rank on a document for hundreds of thousands of similar queries. Similar keyword clusters are grouped together as Utterances within an Intent and hence, relevant results are displayed for the user by detecting their search intent from a query. Intent data is drawn from Intent Dictionary in NLP Manager where various intents can be created manually or through smart Intent Suggestions. This data is utilized to implement tuning for a desired intent of search queries. Select a Search Client for Manual Tuning Manual Tuning is not universal. You can apply is to one search client without making having any impact on others. To get started, pick the search client where tuning is going to be applied. From Search Tuning, go to Manual. Select a search client where Manual Tuning is going to be applied. When there are multiple search clients in a SearchUnify instance and your job is to apply manual tuning to only one of them, you can bookmark your search client by clicking in the Select Search Client dropdown. Enable Intent Tuning Turn on Boost Document for Intent. Search the query you wish to boost the documents for. Then, click Add Intent for a document. On clicking Add Intent, a dialog appears where you can pick an intent from the Select Intent dropdown. In the image, salesforce has been picked. Click Add. To boost a document for more than one intent, simply pick them from the Select Intent dropdown, and click Add. Once you are done, click assign a rank for each intent and click Save. If you see a confirmation message, the document has been boosted for the selected intent(s) successfully. To double-check, search the query again. If you see the Boosted tag, your document has been successfully tuned. You can click on the Boosted Documents button to view the list of all the documents that are currently boosted based on Intent. You can click under the Action column to delete the boosting for a document or edit its rank through the Rank dropdown."

6,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Virtual-Agent/Chat-Transcript.htm,Dig Into Sessions with Chat Transcripts,"Dig Into Sessions with Chat Transcripts Chat Transcript gives you a detailed overview of the sessions in which virtual agent is used. It relies on analytics data to show you the stories having the greatest impact on client satisfaction (measured by successful and unsuccessful sessions) and which stories and intents the admin needs to update. The chart includes eight columns, three filters and a search box. Columns Description Details Session ID The search session ID in which an end-user engages with the virtual agent. This column is searchable. Use the Search by Session ID search box to find a particular session. You can view details on each chatbot session by clicking a Session ID. Intents Used The total number of intents triggered in a chat session. You can filter sessions by intents. To find all the sessions in which a specified intent is triggered, check that intent from the Select Intent dropdown. Last Modified (UTC) This is the time when either an end-user or the virtual agent sent their last message of a chat session. Sessions are arranged by Last Modified in Chat Transcript. Coverage Coverage is the ratio of intents triggered to free utterances. A free utterance is a text input. Clicking on a link or selecting an option is an utterance but not free utterances. Only those utterances are free utterances in which a user inputs text. Clicking ""Content Sources"" is an utterance. Typing ""Content Sources"" is a free utterance. High coverage means that chatbot stories can answer most user queries. Low coverage means that new stories and intents have to be added to answer end-user queries. You can filter chat sessions within a specific coverage range from Range of Coverage%. For example, 70-100 pulls out sessions that have a coverage rate between 70% and 100%. Handover The value is Yes if an end-user connects with a human agent during a chat session. The value is No if the end-user doesn't connect with a human agent during a chat session. This column is not visible if you haven't configured Handover for Salesforce or Zendesk. Successful The value is Yes if a conversation is successful on all the criteria defined in Settings, else the value is No. For information on the available criteria and what they mean, consult Creative ways to measure virtual agent success. User Feedback This column can have two values: View and N/A. View is a link. It opens a dialog, where you can find a list of the stories on which virtual agent received feedback, the actual feedback (thumbs up or thumbs down), and the optional message if the feedback is thumbs down. View is replaced by N/A when there is no feedback shared in a conversation session. Action This feature is used to email transcript. Except for feedback messages, idle user messages, and live chat, all the details in the Chat Transcript report are emailed as a .txt file. No Records Are Available This is the message displayed in Chat Transcript when no sessions are available for the select filters over the specified date range."
7,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Virtual-Agent/Response-Type-Selection.htm,Get to Know Virtual Agent Response Types: Selection,"Get to Know Virtual Agent Response Types: Selection The category Selection offers two response types: Options and Prompt. Options allows an end-user to select one of the predefined input and Prompt allows end-users to compose their own input. Let's review each type. Options Options come in handy in guided conversations, where the user can go down one of the few selected tracks. Options are useful when you, let's say, want to know about the customer's interest in a product and there are only three products: A, B, and C. You can create three nodes for A, B, and C respectively and insert them as options in Configure Response. Unlike other response types, Options can be added only once to a node. Sticking with our example, if A, B, and C are added to node X, then a user clicking any of those products exits node X and moves to the selected node. Click Add Response Type and click Options in Selection. For the first option, enter Node Label and Node Name. If this option is selected, then the end user will be directed to the node whose Label and Name have been specified. Synonyms offer an alternative to selecting nodes. An Admin can type either the Node Label or its value in Synonyms and still be directed to the specified node. Check Disable User If user input is disabled, the end-user cannot type and has to select one of the given options. Sticking to our example, the end-user can select A, B, or C but cannot type. It means that synonyms get disabled in this scenario. To use the selected option later, you can store it into memory. Toggle on Bot Memory to start. Bot Memory is a method to save user’s input for the option response. This can be saved in already existing entity or a new variable. When Bot Memory is toggled on, a new form appears where you can choose to connect the memory with an Entity or a Variable. Finally, you can check Skip if Entity Already Extracted. On checking, the Bot Memory isn't troubled when entity has already been discovered through previous messages from the end-user. In that case, Options responses are skipped if entity is already extracted from utterance or previous responses. NOTE: If the system entity date is selected in bot memory then the end users should input (if text input is available) in the valid date format. NOTE. Entities and variables are reset when the current chatbot story ends i.e. they are re-initialised every time a story is triggered. Prompt While Options guides a conversation by giving an end-user a choice between predefined paths, Prompt brings creativity to the fore. An end-user can type their way to a solution. The virtual agent automatically detects the entities in the end-user responses and replies accordingly. Bot memory is the same as options. Same entity cannot be used more than once for the prompts and options. If an entity is selected in bot memory then it is extracted from the prompt response. Otherwise the entire response is saved in variable. You can skip one or all prompts based on the entities extracted previously in the story. To use Prompt as a response, click Add Response and select Prompt. In the Prompt field in Configure Response, write a message for the end-user, who can read the message and reply to it. The reply is going to be stored. Optionally, check Req. if you want the end user to answer. The conversation doesn't proceed until the end-user has answered to the prompt. You can store the end-user reply in Bot Memory either as an Entity or as a Variable. If you check Skip if Entity Already Extracted. On checking, the Bot Memory isn't troubled when entity has already been discovered through previous messages from the end-user. NOTE: An admin to add entity correctly and add as many synonyms as possible so that the bot can easily extract them. Any value of the entity not available is not detected by the bot e.g. location entity has values only Tokyo and London then bot does not identify if the user enters the location as Moscow. Add or Delete a Response on a Node An admin can insert multiple responses into a node. When business requirements change, the admin can add or delete a response. To add a response to an existing node, click Add a Response and remove an existing response, click . The function is at the extreme right of each response. Once you have made the changes, scroll up and Save them. Change Response Order A node can house two or more responses. In the default set-up, the latest response ends up on top. But you can change the default order. Use to drag responses up and down. Once you have made the changes, scroll up and Save them."

10,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Search-Clients/Analytics-Settings.htm,Analytics Settings,"Turn on Search Analytics Analytics Settings features more than 30 reports, neatly divided into three categories for Community Managers, Content Teams, and Support Teams. Checking a category matching your job profile is the fastest way to set up analytics. Those, who cannot relate to any category, can check out SearchUnify documentation on analytics to ascertain the reports they need. NOTE. You can cherry-pick reports from a category. It's possible to, let's say, check Community Managers and then remove a report or add a report. Activate Search Analytics Open a search client for editing and navigate to Analytics Settings. Check the reports to turn them on. You can select the reports à la carte. For illustration, the first two reports have been checked. Alternatively, you can check All or select one from Community Managers, Content Teams, and Support Teams if any of those categories defines your job profile. Scroll down and Save. Change Report Labels There are pros and cons to altering the default report labels. A big advantage is flexibility which enables you to attain internal consistency with the other platforms you use. If everyone around you calls a content source a ""data repository"" or a ""server"", then you can ease their transition to SearchUnify by renaming Search Index by Content Source to ""Search Index by Data Repository"" or ""Search Index by Server"". A downside of custom labels is the difficulty you might have searching the official docs, participating in the community, or communicating with the SearchUnify support team. But it can be overcome if you stick to using Report Names instead of Custom Names during your communication with SearchUnify. Now to the real work. To change a report's label: Click . Write a new name in the Custom Name column. For illustration, Search Summary has been renamed to ""Search Overview"". Then, click Save. Track Case Deflection with Analytics Properties When a user cannot find an answer from main search, they try to log a ticket. Most organizations have a separate page for accepting tickets. In the SearchUnify parlance, such pages are called Case Creation Pages. SearchUnify can track deflection on a Case Deflection Page, if the page has been set up. To set up a page: Navigate to Analytics Properties. Enter the Case Creation Page URL in Support Page URL. Then toggle Show Stage 2 Deflection (Case Form Page) to the right and Save your settings. NOTE. You can enter a regex pattern in the Support Page URL field if your organization hosts more than one Case Creation Page and case deflection on each of them needs to be tracked. Decide When Sessions Expire A default search session expires if a user stays idle for 60 minutes. The default value can be changed. Enter any value between 1 and 60 in the Session Timeout field. Map Session IDs with Emails Search activity is captured and stored in files called sessions. Each session has an ID. You can connect each ID with an email. Install the Email Tracking addon. The instructions are on Map User IDs with Emails Toggle Email Tracking Enabled to the right. Track Internal and External User Activity The exact definition of internal and external users varies from organization to organization. Generally speaking anyone with an email address ending in @yourcompany.com is an internal user and everyone else is an external user. The support reps handling tickets in Salesforce are internal users and the customers logging those tickets are external users. You can go over internal and external users' search data individuality: how employees use search and how customers use search. Toggle Internal / External Email Tracking Enabled and then enter the domain which will distinguish internal users from external users in Domain Name. For illustration searchunify.com is used. Emails of type john@searchunify or jane@searchunify.com are considered internal users. NOTE. Internal and external user activity can only be monitored on gated platforms. If your search client is on a website which is open to the entire world, then enabling this feature will have no impact whatsoever on the analytics data. Capture Direct Page Views in Session Journey NOTE. For Direct Page Views to work, a tracking script has to be interested in your platform. Please talk with your customer support representative before activating Direct Page Views. A user can get to an article in several ways; search is only one of them. Others include clicking on a bookmarked link, opening an article shared over email, or simply finding your way to an article from the trending list on home. You can measure Stage One and Cumulative Case Deflection from such Directly Viewed Articles as well. To set it, you will have to first activate Direct PageViews. To start, go to Search Clients > Edit > Analytics Settings > Analytics Properties, turn on Show Stage 2 (Case Form Page) Deflection and enter the Support Page URL in the field above. Turn on Add Direct Article View Journey and check Cumulative and Stage 1. Finally, define the URL of your articles. The definition includes <SF_community_address/article/{{URL Field}}. A quicker way to fill the field is to simply use ./article. To find the value for insertion, go to Search Clients > Edit > Content Sources > SF Content Source > Knowledge > Create HREF and drag URL Field to the blank box. Direct Article views influence only Stage 1 Case Deflection. There is no impact on Stage Two Case Deflection and the report behaves identically, irrespective of whether Direct Article views are turned on or not. Another change, when Direct PageView is turned on, is in the Stage One and Cumulative Deflection tabs. All sessions in which a user searched and clicked on a result or access a Direct View article and didn't visit support are considered Stage 1 Case Deflection with Direct PageViews. Only two scenarios are possible. Another difference between Stage One Case Deflection and Stage One Case Deflection with Direct PageViews is the denominator used in the equation used to calculate deflection. In the first, the denominator is Search Sessions but in the second the denominator is Total Sessions. Although the symbol used to represent them is the same, . In this diagram, Total Sessions is 31, Click Sessions with No Support Visit is 5, and Direct Article Views with No Support Visit is 1. Therefore, Direct PageViews impact Cumulative Case Deflection as well where all the deflections in Stage 1 with Direct Article Views and Stage 2 are summed and divided by the Total Sessions."

It's the tool through which end users can find information stored in content sources. Instance admins can install a search client on a website, Salesforce org, Khoros community, or another supported platform. A search client is an interface that a user interacts with to retrieve information from a database. Search interfaces come in several forms. Some tend to be familiar, such as a web search box, desktop search menu, and application search window. Other search interfaces might be cryptic for someone who has not studied computer science. Common examples include, search from a terminal and Boolean search forms. Supported Platforms SearchUnify offers 17 search clients for 12 platforms. Some large platforms, such as Salesforce and Zendesk, have more than one search client. You can view all of them from Search Clients > Add New Search Client.

23,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Search-Analytics/Case-Deflection.htm,Explore How Case Deflection Works,"Explore How Case Deflection Works in Session Analytics Overview Session Analytics Overview measures case deflection on the main search page and support page. On both pages, case deflection can occur in two ways. On the main search page, a Stage One Case Deflection occurs when a user visits a platform where SearchUnify has been set up, searches at least once, clicks a result, and never visits the support page during the session. The second scenario in which a deflection takes place is when a user visits a platform where SearchUnify has been set up, lands on a page described in Direct PageViews, but never searches or visits the support page during the session. When self-service experience doesn't match user expectations and the user lands on Support Page to log a ticket, SearchUnify automatically displays helpful articles related to their issue. If the user clicks on a suggestion and doesn't log the ticket, that counts as Stage Two Case Deflection. The user can land on a Support Page either after searching (first way) or straight from a Direct PageView page (second way). Stage One Case Deflection This is the default view in the Session Analytics Overview report. On checking Successful, the successful user journeys are highlighted in blue. When you click Case Deflection, a dialog opens. On clicking Stage 1 in the dialog, you can view Stage One Case Deflection. Calculate Stage One Case Deflection For most instance users, finding the Stage One Case Deflection is adequate for most everyday purposes. If deflection on search client A is 30.8% in January, 2020 and 57.4% in January, 2021, then you can be pretty sure that the self-service experience has gone up. This section is for you if you are curious beyond just applications and interested in the formula used in calculating Stage One Case Deflection. The formula is rather straightforward: Now let's see how we can find the numerator and denominator for the fraction. But before that, a quick overview of the summary. Term Definition Total Sessions The number of sessions started. It is always equal to Exit. Search Sessions The sessions in which at least one search is performed. Click Sessions Search sessions in which at least one result is clicked. No Click Sessions Search sessions in which the number of clicked results is zero. Support Sessions Sessions in which the user visits Support Page at least once. No Search Session Sessions in which the user runs zero searches. Exit The number of sessions ended. It is always equal to Total Sessions. With the terminology clear, here is an explanation. Total Sessions in the image is 12, Session Sessions is 10, and Click Sessions is 5. And there are 3 sessions in which the user didn't visit Support Page after a Click Session. So, according to the formula Case Deflection should be: And the calculation agrees with the number SearchUnify Analytics shows us. Stage Two Case Deflection User journeys during the second stage case deflection can be viewed by clicking the Stage 2 tile in Sessions Analytics Overview. If you click Successful, the user journeys leading to Stage Two Case Deflections light up in blue. To view the Stage Two Case Deflection rate, click Case Deflection and then Stage 2. Calculate Stage Two Case Deflection This section is for those instance users who are interested in how Stage Two Case Deflection is counted. You can skip if you are short on time. Not knowing the formula will not affect most instance users if all they need is to compare self-service performance on two search clients is the Stage Two Case Deflection rate which is readily available in the report. However, you will want to skim through this section if the support page on your platform is linked with SU and allows end-users to log a case. Looking at the Stage Two Case Deflection rate, you can tell the number of cases deflected and the money saved. Enough of digression. Let's get down to the nitty-gritty. The formula for State Two Case Deflection is: If you see the report, you will find that there is one new term, Case Creation Sessions. The tile refers to the sessions in which at least one ticket is logged. Total Support Sessions in the image is 5, Search Sessions is 3, and Click Sessions is 3. And there is only one session in which the user didn't visit log a case after a Click Session. So, according to the formula Case Deflection should be: The calculation agrees with the number SearchUnify Analytics shows us. Related Enable Stage Two Case Deflection Cumulative Case Deflection Cumulative Case Deflection gives a comprehensive status of self-service on your platform, including both the main search page and support page. To view Cumulative Case Deflection, click Case Deflection first and then Cumulative. The formula for Cumulative Case Deflection is: To figure it out yourself, notice two tiles in Stage One and one in Stage Two. In the image above, Search Sessions = 10. The number of Click Sessions after which a user didn't visit Support Page in Stage One is 3 and the number of Click Sessions after which a user didn't log a ticket in Stage Two is 1. So our formula becomes: Direct PageViews A user can get to an article in several ways; search is only one of them. Others include clicking on a bookmarked link, opening an article shared over email, or simply finding your way to an article from the trending list on home. You can measure Stage One and Cumulative Case Deflection from such Directly Viewed Articles as well. To set it, you will have to first activate Direct PageViews. To start, go to Search Clients > Edit > Analytics Settings > Analytics Properties, turn on Show Stage 2 (Case Form Page) Deflection and enter the Support Page URL in the field above. Turn on Add Direct Article View Journey and check Cumulative and Stage 1. Finally, define the URL of your articles. The definition includes <SF_community_address/article/{{URL Field}}. A quicker way to fill the field is to simply use ./article. To find the value for insertion, go to Search Clients > Edit > Content Sources > SF Content Source > Knowledge > Create HREF and drag URL Field to the blank box. Direct Article views influence only Stage 1 Case Deflection. There is no impact on Stage Two Case Deflection and the report behaves identically, irrespective of whether Direct Article views are turned on or not. Another change, when Direct PageView is turned on, is in the Stage One and Cumulative Deflection tabs. All sessions in which a user searched and clicked on a result or access a Direct View article and didn't visit support are considered Stage 1 Case Deflection with Direct PageViews. Only two scenarios are possible. Another difference between Stage One Case Deflection and Stage One Case Deflection with Direct PageViews is the denominator used in the equation used to calculate deflection. In the first, the denominator is Search Sessions but in the second the denominator is Total Sessions. Although the symbol used to represent them is the same, . In this diagram, Total Sessions is 31, Click Sessions with No Support Visit is 5, and Direct Article Views with No Support Visit is 1. Therefore, Direct PageViews impact Cumulative Case Deflection as well where all the deflections in Stage 1 with Direct Article Views and Stage 2 are summed and divided by the Total Sessions."

On search clients where email tracking is enabled, you can pick Internal to view how your employees are interacting with search and External to view how your clients are searching. Select Search Client. When you have more than one search client, choose the one whose data ought to be in the report. Date Range. The default range is one month. It can be contracted to a day and extended to 180 days. Download a Report After running the reports, find the one you want to download in Overview, Conversions, or Content Gap Analysis and click . Open a Downloaded Report Reports are downloaded as zipped CSV files. The first step to opening a report is to unzip the downloaded report. Next, use Excel, or a program that supports CSV files, to open the report. If you have opened the Session Analytics Details report and the Session Identifier column might as a list of scientific numbers. To view session IDs, select the Session Identifier column, right click, and click Format Cells. Check Number, reduce Decimal Places to 0, and click OK. You can now see the session IDs. Share an Analytics Report After running the reports, find the one you want to share in Overview, Conversions, or Content Gap Analysis and click When you are downloading a report, the dialog with your email address in the Email field opens. If you want to send a report to yourself, click Send. Else, enter the email of the receiver. You can enter multiple emails and use commas to separate them. TIP: Hit enter after typing an email address for the value to be saved. Download Sessions Tracking Details However, if you are downloading Session Tracking Details, then three more fields will appear besides Email: Select Date Format, Activity Count, and Advanced Facet Details. In the first, you can choose the date-time format (details next) and in the latter you can configure how you want user activities to appear in the downloaded report. Select Date Format .On selecting DD-MM-YYYY + Time, you will see the date and activity time in the columns Session Start Time, Session End Time, and Activity Time of the downloaded or shared report. Selecting the second option will cause the time to vanish. Activity Count In the default format, each row in a session repeats three key pieces of information: searches, clicks, and cases. To read a session, you start from the lowest row and read upwards. The next image is a report of session 1602160226239364, in which (1) A user visits a page, (2) visits support, (3) performs a search, (4) visits support again, (5) then clicks a search result, (6) searches for something, (7) logs a ticket, (8) searches again, and (9) finally logs a ticket and ends the session. In this journey, the user searches three times (steps 3, 6, and 8), clicked on a search result once (step 5), and logs two tickets (step 7 and 9). The information on searches, clicks, and cases is repeated in all the nine rows of the session. This view has an advantage that a mere glance at any session row reveals the searches and clicks performed and the cases logged in that session. But an alternative view exists for those who are more interested in whether a particular activity is a search, click, or case or not. They can check Per Activity and download the Session Tracking Details report. The same session (1602160226239364) in the new format is in the next image. Adding all the 1s in the Search column still gives you three. The Clicks are still 1 and the Cases 2. But instead of repeating the total in each row, Per Activity view inserts a 1 (yes) when the activity tokens place and 0 (no) when activity doesn't take place. Starting from Colubridae '21, facet details can be downloaded and shared. To use this feature, simply click Include Advanced Facet Details. Six facet details columns will appear in the downloaded report: Facet ID. An internal representation of a Facet Type. Facet Type. A grouping of similar facets. All your content sources can be grouped into the Facet Type Sources and all the time values can be grouped into Created Date, Last Updated, or another similar Facet Type. Facet Value. All the buttons inside a Facet Type that can be checked inside. For instance, 2021-01-01 and 2021-10-01 can be Facet Values in Created Date. Internal and External can be Facet Values in User Type. Exact Phrase. The part of the query in an advanced search that is enclosed between two double quotes. For # search ""clients"", you will find clients in this column. With One or More. Without the Words. The part of the query in an advanced search that is preceded by a minus sign. For # search -client, you will find client in this column.

The impact, measured in terms of article shares, can be converted into hours of effort and dollars saved. Here’s a hypothetical scenario. An agent spends, on average, an hour to solve a repeat ticket. Now, if the agent, a technical writer, and an approver spend 8 hours collectively to transform a ticket into a published article and over the course of a year following its creation, the article is shared 20 times, then the support team can save 12 hours because instead of repeating a solution on phone or typing it in a mail, the agent can simply paste the link to the published article in response to the repeat ticket. The savings, both in dollars and in time, add up quickly when multiple agents and hundreds of articles are involved. Going over the report at regular intervals, you can also get a handle on who among your agents is most active in drafting the most shared articles. Fig. 1 The report is sorted by article IDs which are to be found in the first column, Article (#). The octothorpe represents the total number of articles published. In Fig. 1, four articles have been published with the IDs 000001004, 000001005, 000001006, and 000001007. Article Title serves two functions: A quick survey of this column provides a reader a gut feeling about the kind of articles being created and a search function (Fig. 2) helps a reader quickly pull up any article and see how many times it has been shared. Fig. 2 In the Author Email Id field are captured the email addresses of the support agents who are drafted in the articles. In Fig. 1, you can spot that both the articles are drafted by sumit.aggarwal@gmail.com. Created Date displays the date of creation of the article. Fig. 3 If measuring productivity is your goal then Total Shares is the column you should keep an eye on. It displays the share count of each article. The number field in each row is clickable and can be utilized to further find out: ONLY FOR SALESFORCE CLASSIC.

Each metric has its own tile where you can view approximate numbers, such as Search Sessions: 19K and Clicks: 7K. On hovering over a tile, the exact numbers appear, such as Search Sessions: 19542 and Clicks 7321. Tiles All Sessions A session is a group of interactions between a user and your website, community, or another platform that takes place during a specified period. Sessions give an exact estimate of the number of times users visited your website and for an activity or transaction. All Sessions shows the entire number of such interactions. It is used as a measure of the amount of traffic a website gets. You can determine the time frame of a user session. For example, 30 minutes or 1 hour. If a visitor stops doing any activity on your website for longer than your time frame, then that session ends. Search Sessions The sum of sessions in which at least one search was performed. Clicks The total number of results opened across all your search results pages in all sessions. It helps you to accurately determine the effectiveness of site search and the resources in your data repository. It can happen that a user makes multiple clicks on a search results page. The number of sessions with at least one click are mentioned just under total clicks in Successful Sessions. Cases Logged The total number of cases created on the support page where a search client is installed. It can happen that a user ends up logging more than one case in a session. Total Searches The total number of times search was used on your website or community. It is a measure of total search volume on a search client. Each facet selection or deselection, navigation to a new results page, reloading of the search results page, advanced search, or changing search settings in preferences counts as a separate search. Searches with Result Searches with results refer to the list that is created in response to a search query. These are the searches for which at least one result is produced. Searches with No Results Searches for which no result is produced. A search can be no-result for multiple reasons: Documents with the search keywords do not exist in your data repositories. The user does not have the permission to see documents. Your search client is not connected with the content source where the documents are stored. Unique Searches The total number of times your website or community search was used, excluding facet selection or deselection. It doesn't count auto suggestion.

34,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/FAQs/How-SearchUnify-Works.htm,How Does SearchUnify Work?,"How Does SearchUnify Work? Despite being all round us, the technology underpinning search remains a mystery to most. The details tend to be buried in research papers and official documentation which but only a few can access, let alone read and comprehend. Fast technological progress doesn't lend a hand. Neither a proliferation of marketing jargon which confuses, more than it enlightens, readers. A lot of readers will benefit from something between superficial marketing assets and a full-blown research paper. That's exactly what this article aims to be. It explains the core principles powering SearchUnify. Because the principles are fundamental, they apply to most other search engines as well. Check out the following articles to learn how SearchUnify works. Crawl Content Sources A summary of how the data in content sources is processed and transformed into a searchable index.

35,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/NLP-Manager/Intents.htm,Intents,"Boost Documents with Intents We see the scope of intent based intelligence in Virtual Agent, where it has proved to be a raving accomplishment. For the ones unfamiliar with Intents in Virtual Agents app functionality, consider these 3 sentences - ‘How are you today?’, ‘Hello there!, and ‘Hey, fella!’. All of these variants can be put under the same theme which is ‘greetings’. In SearchUnify terminology, these variants are Utterances and the theme is an Intent. Under the Intents tab in NLP Manager, user search queries are analysed and grouped into Intents and Utterances. By incorporating this intent analysis in the search algorithm, an Admin can aim to achieve a detailed spectrum of the nature of search queries they receive and consider it a factor when showing the top search results on the search client. If there are thousands of search sessions, Admin can rely on Intents to figure out where most of the search queries are coming from. This intent data can then be extended to Intent Tuning to achieve intelligent intent based tuning. Add Intent Click Create New Intent. In the Create New Intent dialog box, mention the Intent Name of your choice and the Intent Description. This description is displayed when a cursor is hovered over the intent’s name. Click Save. The intent should be added on the main screen. Add Utterances Go to the Intent where utterances need to be added and under the Action column, click on the Manage Utterance icon. In Add Your Utterance search bar, you can look for the related utterances to your intent. As you click on it, utterance suggestions are displayed to make your job easier. Select your utterance, and click on the Add new utterance icon. You should see the new utterance added to your Intent. To edit it, you can click on the Move Utterance icon under the Action column. Once edited, click on the (save icon) to save your changes. The number of utterances to be displayed on the page can be selected by Items per page dropdown. (Image) Delete You can remove intents and utterances with Delete. Deleting an Intent To delete an Intent, click on the delete icon under the Action column for an intent you wish to delete. Deleting an Utterance To delete an utterance, you can select them individually or select the checkbox given in the title of the Utterance column to select all at once. Once selected, click on the Delete button. A prompt appears asking you to confirm the deletion. Click on Delete. Note that if all utterances are deleted under an intent, then the intent is also automatically deleted. Intent Suggestions Admin can click on the Intent Suggestions button to get smart suggestions for adding intents and utterances to the existing list or create new ones. To add Intent Suggestions From the Select Search Client dropdown, select the search clients you intend to apply these Click on the Intent Suggestion button. Utterances will be displayed within an undefined intent name that can be renamed by the admin. Two rows of utterances are displayed by default. In case there are more, click on View More to check them all. Note - No more than 30 utterances can be displayed at a time in an intent group. To create a new intent with these utterances, select the intent (by default all the utterances in it are also selected) and from the three dots under the Action column, click on Move Intent. To add the suggested utterances to an existing intent, select the required utterances and click on Move Utterance in the Actions column. In the Move Utterance dialog box, select the intent to which you wish to add the selected utterances. Click on Move. Click on the Train Intent button to draw new intent suggestions and train the intent intellect. By default, Intent training takes place fortnightly. Import Intents If you have a separate database for intents, an option of Import Intent (icon) allows you to add them directly into your Intent Dictionary. There is a sample file that can be downloaded for reference."

But sometimes, an admin might want to turn it off for certain keywords. Those keywords could be product names that aren't part of the standard language. Consider the case of Copy-Cat Organization who has come up with a brand new insect repellant, ""Salesforc"". After winning the battle to get it trademarked, they are now confronted with another challenge. Every time a customer looks up ""salesforc"", Did You Mean suggests ""Salesforce.""

37,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Release-Notes/Colubridae-21-Release-Notes.htm,Colubridae '21 Release Notes,"Skip To Main Content Account Settings Logout placeholder Account Settings Logout Filter: All Files Submit Search Account Settings Logout You are here: Colubridae '21 Release Notes For the first time in SearchUnify’s history, a Colubridae release has been announced in the middle of June instead of the last week of April. We used the six extra weeks to jam pack the latest SearchUnify version with the features you asked for and will love, while also managing to sneak in a few others to surprise you. The biggest highlight of this release is the Virtual Agent Story Board. The next big change concerns NLP Manager and Search Tuning. And it doesn’t end there. In addition, a host of new content sources, advanced filters in Session Tracking Details, and dozens of small and big changes await you in C21. Release Schedule Colubridae '21 was announced on 17 June, 2021. The new version starts rolling out to customers for sandbox deployment towards the end of June, and production deployment begins in the beginning of August. All updates-related queries can be directed to support@searchunify.com. Core Platform The updates in the core platform concern Home screen, Content Sources, Search Clients, Search Analytics, Search Tuning, NLP Manager, and Administration. 1. Home The new SearchUnify Help virtual assistant becomes the star feature on Home. Among other changes, and it is now possible to pin search clients in Recommendations and Case Deflection widgets. Virtual Agent Dons a New Avatar: SearchUnify Help Assistant Now you can opt for SearchUnify Help, an intuitive virtual assistant that can be used to seek assistance for your queries, access all help resources with a click, and leave feedback. The complete list of the assistant capabilities are on Home. Scroll down to SearchUnify Help Assistant to read. Recommendations That Stand Out In Home, Recommendations hosts two reports and gets its own section. Scroll down to the section to obtain Actionable Insights on a search engine and suggestions on the Next Best Action. You will no longer need to select a required search client every time you look at Case Deflection or Actionable Insights, for a new feature in these reports allows you to pin a search client. That means each time you log in, you obtain the data for the pinned search client. A great feature if your job requires you to stay on top of only one search client. Find Super Admin from the Menu Bar The person with the right to make any change in your SearchUnify instance shouldn’t be a mystery, so we made it easier to find your Super Admin. Simply click the blue shield in the Menu Bar. Another change in the Menu Bar is the removal of My Account. The tab has been renamed to “Account Information” and has been moved to Administration. Check out the Administration section for details. More information: Scroll Down to Find Super Admin 2. Content Sources C21 contains out-of-the-box support for a new content source, extended support for Khoros and Salesforce (Appinium LearnTrac and ViewTrac objects), and a brand new button that gives you more control over content source edits. Index and Search Product Ideas in Aha! We have great news for those teams who store product ideas in Aha!. The platform can now be connected with SearchUnify with a few clicks. You can index and search ideas for the whole product. The configuration instructions are in the documentation. More information: Use Aha as a Content Source Discourse Topics that Stick All the discussions in Discourse can now be searched from any search client. A new crawl supports Discourse out-of-the-box. More information: Use Discourse as a Content Source Use Thought Industries Courses as Reference Completing a course from start to finish is great when you are new to a team and have ample time to go through the materials. However, those who are just looking to consult a topic to solve a problem at hand can use SearchUnify to locate the topic. A new crawler can index Thought Industries data out-of-the-box. More information: Use Thought Industries as a Content Source Find With a Click: Who Last Changed Your Content Source Who Changed Last is for teams who collectively look after several content sources. It is possible for a teammate to change the crawl frequency of your content source without notifying you. When such a thing happens, you don’t have to lose time to hunt down the editor. Simply scroll down to your content source and hover the cursor over ICON in the Name. The creator of the content source and the last editor will be instantly revealed. More information: Find Content Source Name, Creator, and Latest Editor More Powerful Website Crawler Indexes Custom Fields Indexing a web page is currently limited to three elements: HTML tags, CSS IDs, and CSS classes, but that changes after Colubridae ‘21. New methods allow Instance Managers to crawl custom fields and fetch information such as time, URL, or the value stored in a specified column and row of a table. Khoros Crawler Can Index Group Hubs and Nested Categories Group Hubs are a cool feature in Khoros. Starting from Colubridae '2021, you can crawl and index the data stored in Group Hubs. Also, C’21 brings support for nested categories (Category_nested and Category_flat) as well. And the good things don’t end there. Native-filter Topics with No Result (renamed to Replied) are now searchable as well. 3. Search Clients Colubridae ‘21 brings a refashioned screen to add search clients and edit content sources in it, an improved Create Formula feature, and a configurable way to set default preferences. Revamped Way to Add Search Clients We experimented with Content Sources categories in the previous releases, and it elicited rave reviews from Instance Users. So this time, we are extending categories to Search Clients. Instead of scrolling down all the way to find your search client, you can simply look it up or discover it in a category. More information: Add a Search Client New “Edit Content Sources” Screen The Edit Content Sources screen has been revamped. The most visible change is a new search box in the Field column. Using the search feature, an SU Admin can easily look up a content field. A sorting option (icon) is introduced in each field that gets the already selected values at the top followed by other unselected fields. Also, it is now possible to put together multiple fields to assemble a Title. For instance, you can club fields such as Case ID, Case Agent, and Created Date to create a title ""AB12340 - Hikiro Mishima - 2021/09/21"". The feature is named Compose Title. Updated Create Formula In his A Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking writes that he was told that each mathematical equation decreases the sales by half. In the whole book, he used only one: E = mc2. After reading Hawking, one of our developers decided to do something with the scary-looking equations in Create Formula. He teamed up with a designer and both came up with Map Rules into Formula, where you can draw rules instead of stringing them into equations. The new method is visually appealing and more intuitive. For the geeks, the old system hasn’t been dismantled. You decide whether to write or draw equations. More information: Use Create Formula for Document- and Role-Based Access Control Index Nested Categories in Salesforce Knowledge Now there is an option not to bundle similar categories into a filter. Out-of-the-box support for Category_nested means that you get to decide how deeply you want to crawl a group hierarchy. Values between 1 and 5 can be chosen and each hierarchical level gets its own set of filters. “Change Default Preferences” Renamed to “Set Default Preferences” Besides a new name, four new tabs have been introduced: Content Tabs, Facets, Label, and Summary Field. These new features make the search results page more configurable. An instance user can hide the content sources tab, reorder facets, tweak the summary text length, and even set the value that will appear in the content tag. Trace Search Client Changes to a Person with “Who Changed Last” Who Changed Last is for teams who collectively look after several search clients. It is possible for a teammate to add or remove a content source without notifying you. When such a thing happens, you don’t have to lose time to hunt down the editor. Simply scroll down to your search client and hover the cursor over ICON in the Name. Creator of the search client and last editor will be instantly revealed. More information: Find Search Client Name, Creator, and Recentmost Editor Special Character Search in Search Client Configurations Ampersand (&), Dollar ($), Asterisk (*) and many more special characters are now searchable. To use, simply turn on Special Character Search on Configurations. The complete list of support characters and the scenarios where they are searchable has been described in search client configurations. Scroll down to the fourth section, Special Character Search. 4. Search Analytics We are unveiling a completely revamped High Conversion Results Not On Page One report, more user-friendly Session Tracking Details, search and sort options in Search Report, and some new metrics in Tiles. New Metrics Introduced in Tiles On the Overview tab, the Clicks tile has gained a metric, Successful Sessions, where the sessions in which at least one search and click are performed are listed. On the Content Gap Analysis tab, the Searches with no clicks tile now has a Sessions with no clicks count, telling you how many sessions in the given searches did not contain a click. Finally, the Searches with no result tile on the Content Gap Analysis tab now shows the number of Sessions with no results. More information: Overview Tiles Another change in the Tiles manifests when you hover the cursor over a metric value. In a tooltip, the exact value of a metric is displayed. The first tile, All Sessions, can be 737K but on hovering you can spot the exact value 737255. “High Conversion Results Not On Page One” Captures New Metrics Instead of merely a list of documents that aren’t on page one, you get a complete report on the sessions in which the documents are consulted and another report on click patterns. The new report is a content strategist’s dream come true as it entails detailed session analysis including Document Title, Session ID, Search Query, Facet Selected, and much more. More information: High Conversion Results Not On Page One Searchable Queries, Sortable Users and Sessions in Search Report You can pull any query in the Search Report by searching for it. The Query column is searchable now and Users and Sessions columns are sortable. The fourth column, Sessions, isn’t merely sortable, but also contains facet reports. Clicking any row in the column opens a dialog informing you about the facets used. More information: Search Report with New Metrics Exact Conversion Rate Visible in Session Analytics Overview To indicate more precise values, the Session Analytics Overview report under the Conversions tab now shows the Case Deflection calculation up to 2 decimal places for Cumulative, Stage 1 and Stage 2 instead of rounding it off. More information: Explore How Case Deflection Works in Session Analytics Overview Leaner and Insightful Session Tracking Details Quick Filters, Filter by Activity Type, Show Activity Type, and a new filter named Content Facets have all been moved to Apply Filters which can be accented from the top right of the report. Content Facets allows you to filter sessions by content type. For instance, you can pull up sessions in which someone clicked a particular Product or a Category. Finally, while sharing or downloading Sesion Tracking Details, you can choose to have information on facets and pick your favorite date format. More information: Meet the New Search Tracking Details Report 5. NLP Manager NLP Manager now has the ability to group search queries based on Intent and turn off exact matches for Add Synonyms. Suggestion Removal has been renamed to Hide Suggestions, which can now be looked for under the Did You Mean tab. Did You Mean and Suggestions Removal: Strong Together Suggestions Removal has been merged into the Did You Mean tab and renamed Hide Suggestions. The Did You Mean feature now houses two screens: Custom Dictionary and Hide Suggestions. The latter is used to hide Did You Mean suggestions for the select keywords. More information: Providing Useful Suggestions to Misspelled Queries with Did You Mean Turn Off Exact Matches in Add Synonyms SU Admins can turn on or turn off word-order matches with Exact Match in Add Synonyms. When Exact Match is turned on “operating system” is treated as a phrase, but when it is turned off “operating system” becomes “operating AND system.” Word order loses meaning. The option to turn off Exact Match is now available as a toggle in Colubridae ‘21. More information: Add Synonyms to Improve Search Experience Group Similar Queries Into Intents () Intents group search queries into categories, and each category is assigned an intent. For SU Admins managing search clients with hundreds of thousands of queries a week, this feature helps them discover trends. For instance, 10% of queries are about installation, 30% about product issues, and so on. Intents are created with the in-built AI. To accelerate learning, you can upload any existing data on queries as well. More information: Group Related Queries into Intents 6. Search Tuning A more structured interface is now divided into 3 sections - Auto, Manual, and Test Your Tuning. We’ve introduced a new Intent Tuning method, extended Keyword Tuning to synonyms, and allowed Content Tuning based on content fields and objects. Boost Similar Queries with Search-Based Intent Tuning Machine Learning finds its way in document boosting through Intent Tuning. It is similar to Keyword Tuning in the sense that you can boost a document for multiple keywords simultaneously. However, the difference is that, instead of boosting a document for a query and a few of its synonyms, Intent Tuning allows you to put a custom rank on a document for hundreds of thousands of similar queries based on the user intent. Search queries are analysed for intent detection under NLP Manager which are then utilized for Intent Tuning. More information: Boost Related Queries with New Tuning Feature, Intents Keyword Tuning: “What’s in a name?” or Synonyms Boosting In the days of yore, you had to boost a document for “case” and “ticket” and its thousand synonyms. Fast forward to Colubridae ‘21 and if you boost a document for “case,” it will be boosted for all the “case” synonyms as well. More information: Boost Documents for Specific Keywords and Their Synonyms Each Object and Field Counts in New Content Tuning Until now, you could boost all the documents for, let’s say, YouTube, Salesforce, or Zendesk. It was a useful feature, but Colubridae ‘21 makes Content Tuning indispensable. Instead of pushing up all the documents in a content source, you can fine tune boosting to objects and content fields. More information: Boost All Documents in a Content Source Test Your Tuning Unveils the Mystery of Rank We’ve always had a sense of the impact of keyword boosting, content boosting, and custom boosting on a doc. After the current release, this sense has been transformed to concrete knowledge. Next to each result in Test Your Tuning, you can find the doc’s organic rank, the impact of all kinds of boosting on it, and the boosting rank. If you find the explanation useful, simply email search results with an explanation to your teammates. You can share up to 20,000 search results in an email. More information: Test Your Tuning Right Inside the Instance Keyword Boosting: Boost Once, Use a Trillion Times SU Admins spend a long time customizing their search engine for end-users. For most, the tinkering never stops. Now imagine their plight if they have to redo the whole thing for a new set of similar users. The newest version of Keyword Boosting is exactly for such scenarios. The Admins can simply copy all the keyword boosting settings from one search client to another with the click of a button. That’s how easy it is. A second change is a Boosted Queries column. An SU Admin can now look up documents boosted by keywords, change their rank, and add more keywords to the boosting. 7. Administration New release brings the freedom to select Content Source Alerts according to requirement, My Account is renamed and moved, and Admin Logs now tracks major changes made across the instance. Renamed and Moved: “My Account” to “Account Information” Stay on top of Usage Details, view all SearchUnify instances, and obtain Account Details from the “My Account” tab, which has been rebranded to “Account Information.” Besides being renamed, the tab has moved from Menu to Administration. Change your bookmarks! More information: View Account Information in Administration Count Successes and Failures with Content Source Alerts Successful. Failed. Successful. Failed. Successful. Failed. To some, the notification emails after each crawl are music; but for others, they’re an irritating noise. The new Content Source Alerts settings are for both groups. The former can subscribe to “All” alerts and the latter, depending on their requirements and preferences, can choose to stay on top of either “Successful” or “Failed” crawls. More information: Turn on Content Source Indexing Notifications Track Changes to a Person with Admin Logs The new “Admin Logs” tracks all changes in Content Sources, Search Clients, Search Tuning, NLP Manager, API, and Apps. Data up to six months old can be pulled up in batches of one day, one week, or even three months. More information: View Instance Manager Activity in Admin Logs SearchUnify Applications Emojis in Escalation Predictor, a new editor in KCS Support Console, and a brand new experience for chatbot managers and end-users are awaiting you in C '21. 1. Escalation Predictor Reign of Emojis in Escalation Predictor Kicks Off Emojis have come a long way since they were first used by computer scientist Scott Fahlman in 1982. Today you can find them on all the major social media platforms. With Colubridae ‘21, SearchUnify has put them to use in an enterprise setting. On updating your instance, you will find a revamped Escalations Dashboard screen where key snippets from a case description and a bunch of emojis reveal a customer’s mood. More information: Revamped Escalation Predictor App 2. KCS Helper KCS Support Console Has New Features for Admins and Support Reps The KCS Support Console configuration dashboard offers the same experience for both Salesforce Classic and Salesforce Lightning. SU Admins can also configure draft visibility settings. As for support agents, they can now create, edit, and share articles right from inside the app. Not just that, they get a new WYSIWYG editor, which means that they can more easily adhere to smartlinks, indentation, and font style guides. Also, depending on visibility settings, they can view other agents’ articles as well. More information: Install KCS Support Console in Salesforce Console 3. Chatbot Meet StoryBoard: Chatbot Conversations’ Cleaner, More Visual Avatar In the old Conversations, the nodes (Intent + Response) were listed one after another. It was impossible to find the connections between them quickly. StoryBoard (earlier called Conversations) changes all that. With a new view, anyone can figure out immediately how nodes come together in a story. More information: Check out the new Story Board The new interface is more than just eye candy. Previously, SU Admins had to select the intent for each node. For 20 nodes in a story, they had to select an intent 20 times. C21 changes all that. With one intent selection, admins can create a story with 20, 50, or any number of nodes. On top of all these improvements, SU Admins also get more control over conversations through Pause and Skip (for response types Options and Prompt). They can also improve the Hybrid Chat experience by offering end-users the ability to connect with a Salesforce agent right in the chat window. Right now, a pop-up is the only way to connect and available only for the Salesforce platform. Support teams on Zendesk can celebrate as well because support for hybrid-chat (virtual agent and support rep) has been extended to the Zendesk platform. Create Cases, Talk to Agents, and Find Articles with Adapters Four adapters have been reorganized into four categories: Create Case, Create Discussion, Connect to Live Agent, and Fallback (SU Adapter). With Lithium and Salesforce adapters, you can empower end-users to create cases and discussions. With Salesforce and Zendesk adapters, you can allow end-users to connect with a support rep. Finally, the SearchUnify adapter brings relevant content right inside the chat window when all else fails. New Configurations in Theme Editor A downside of multitasking is that you can start a chat with a virtual agent and then forget about it. A new configuration in Theme Editor allows SU Admins to show a pop-up whenever the end-user goes idle. The Admins can specify the inactivity period after which an end-user will be considered idle and write a custom message either on the virtual agent icon or right inside the chat window. View Messages from the Past with Chat History It is sometimes useful to be able to view chat history to recall why you started a conversation in the first place. In such scenarios, simply scroll up to view chat history. In Virtual Agents powered by Colubridae ‘21, chat history is maintained until the end user explicitly resets (deletes) it or the search session ends. More information: View Chat History on a Virtual Agent Bye Bye, Bugs! Don’t lose settings after you reindex a content source. Right now, when you reindex YouTube, all your settings in Search Clients > Edit > By Channels vanish. This has been fixed. Now you can reindex any of these content sources without losing settings: C21. The other content sources impacted are: Vimeo, Slack, Jira, Sharepoint, Github, Confluence, Zendesk, Khoros, Azure, Higher Logic, and Service Now. Be on top of applied advanced filters and facets. What was the filter that you applied? What is AND, OR, or Exclude? Such questions become history with C’21. End-users can clearly see advanced filters and applied facets right on the search results page. Search operators are more intuitive now. How does SearchUnify interpret a query such as keyword_1 AND keyword_2 OR keyword_3? There was much confusion around that. But that has been fixed by the developers and the new documentation Last updated: Wednesday, June 16, 2021 Was this article helpful?

To use the feature, navigate to Keyword Based in Search Tuning and perform the following steps. Select a Search Client for Manual Tuning Manual Tuning is not universal. You can apply is to one search client without making having any impact on others. To get started, pick the search client where tuning is going to be applied. From Search Tuning, go to Manual. Select a search client where Manual Tuning is going to be applied. When there are multiple search clients in a SearchUnify instance and your job is to apply manual tuning to only one of them, you can bookmark your search client by clicking in the Select Search Client dropdown. Enable Keyword Tuning In Keyword, toggle Boost search results for specific search queries to view settings. Run a search. Click Add Keywords to select a document. A dialog will open. Enter a query or a query pattern in the form of Regex and click Add. The query or pattern will vanish from the search bar on pressing Add and a slider will appear. Move the slider to select a rank, which can be any integer between 1 and 10, and click Save. Now the selected document will have the new rank for the keyword. Move to Test Your Tuning, select your search client, and run your search again with the same keyword to view the tuned results. If the order of documents has changed in Test Your Tuning, then it has successfully changed for search client users as well. Regex and Keyword Tuning You can boost documents for keywords as well as regex query patterns. For instance, Document X for query ""search"" and for a pattern ""/search??/"" boosts Document X for ""search"", ""Search"", ""SEARCH"", ""searches"", ""SEARCHES"", ""Searches"" and several other matching patterns. In the following image, SearchUnify* and Data AND Protection are regex-based queries. In case a document is boosted for both a query and a pattern, then the query ranking takes precedence. The order of precedence is: Exact keyword boosting > Synonym pair boosting > Regex Boosting. A way to get the most out of regex-based keyword tuning is to narrow the scope of patterns. .* matches all queries. Such a pattern, to put it mildly, is not of much use. A pattern, such as /search/, is little better than a query. The ideal regex is somewhere between these extremes, where scope of pattern expansion is limited to a couple of dozen keywords and not hundreds or thousands of potential queries. Here are a few examples. Pattern Boosts ^(.*?)reporting 2.0.*$ Documents that contain “reporting 2.0”. Example: <any_word> reporting 2.0 <any_word>. ^.*(reporting 2.0|working).*$ Documents that contain either “reporting 2.0” or “working” or both.

Example: <any_word> CENG-123 <any_word> Related: Use Regex in Keyword Boosting to Handle Query Inflexion Import Tuning Keyword Boosting is a time-consuming affair. An SU Admin analyzes search behavior and organizational goals before curating a list of results to boost. During the course of a few months or years, the SU Admin can end up boosting hundreds of documents on a search client. Great as it is for end users, without Import Tuning the entire thing can turn into a maintenance nightmare if the Moderator, Admin, or Super Admin has to boost exactly the same documents on another search client. When a content source is linked with multiple search clients, then an instance user can copy the keyword-based tuning settings for that content source from one search client to another. Example 1. When keyword boost settings can be imported. Article ""Unable to login"" has been boosted for the keyword ""Login"" for the first rank on search client X. The same article is boosted for the keyword ""unable"" on the search client Y to rank two. On import, the article will be boosted for two different keywords for two separate ranks. Example 2. When keyword boost settings cannot be imported. Article ""Unable to login"" has been boosted for the keyword ""Login"" for the first rank on search client X. The same article is boosted for the keyword ""unable"" on the search client Y to rank one. You cannot import boost settings in this case. Import Tuning saves a lot of repetitive work when the goal is to boost the documents in a content source or content type, already keyword-boosted on a search client. It works excellently for content sources shared between two or more search clients. With the theory clear, you can now proceed to import keyword-tuning settings from one search client into another. From Select Search Client, pick a search client from which Keyword Based Tuning settings will be imported. In the Select column, check the content sources and content types. Click Import and you will see a success message. In case if an article is boosted on each search client with different keywords and ranks, the article will be import to new client as per it is set in all search clients. Synonyms Boost Apply the same Keyword Tuning on the added Synonyms/Abbreviations lets you extend the scope of keyword boosting to its synonyms as well. You boost a document once for a keyword, let's say, ""SU"", and it's boosted for all its added synonyms, such as ""searchunify"" and ""sfy"". But there is a catch. If there are 10 documents boosted for ""SU"", 20 for ""searchunify"" and 10 for ""sfy"", and an end-user searches ""SU"", then the resulted boosted for ""searchunify"" shall come up first because it has the most documents. When there is a parity between two synonyms, the results for a synonym are picked at random. Also, when the query and the boosted keyword match is partial, then the keyword's synonyms are ignored. For the synonym boost to work, a precondition is to use a string instead of a regex pattern. Keyword boosting a document for the pattern ""Search*"" will not be automatically boosted for synonyms such as ""SearchUnify"" and ""SU"". Boosted Documents The list of boosted documents can quickly spiral into a long list so that it becomes difficult for any person to remember what documents have been boosted and for what keywords. In such scenarios, instance users can resort to Boosted Documents. Boosted Documents isn't limited to passive viewing. The user can look up boosted documents, change their rank, and add more keyword to the boosting. Boosted Documents. A list of docs along with the keyword(s) for which they are boosted, and the boosted rank. Instance users can remove a boosting. Boosted Queries. A list of keywords for which one or more documents have been boosted. Instance users can remove a boosting settings. To find both lists, click Boosted Documents in Keyword Tuning.

Search Tuning offers four ways to tweak your results and a method to test your tweaks. You can turn on or turn off tuning on a search client with the toggle of a button and effects will be immediately visible. Auto Tuning (Start Here) If you are new and do not know where to begin, you can just turn on Auto Tuning. Auto Tuning analyzes and keeps a record of user activity data to identify patterns. Based on the analysis, it then changes the order of search results for individual users based on their activity. Manual Tuning This tab consists of four features. Intent Boosting Intent boosting helps you assign a rank to a document for thousands of related keywords grouped together as an intent. Check out Intent Tuning for details. Keyword Boosting If you wish to boost documents for any specific keywords, Keyword Based Tuning is what you need. This allows the admin to arrange the order of the top 10 search results for any keyword. Content Source Tuning Content-Based Tuning helps if you wish to boost a specific content source and want that more documents should appear in the search results from that source. Custom (Advanced) Custom Tuning allows you to personalize results in your search client by boosting content based on factors such as title match, date of publishing, and popularity among support reps. Test Your Tuning To test the effects of your search tuning, go to the Test Your Tuning section. It replicates the behavior of your search client and will give you an idea of how your search will look after the applied boosting. Last updated: Wednesday, March 30, 2022 Was this article helpful?

What kinds of books do you have? BOT. All kinds! USER. A copy of Russian Grammar by Potapova? BOT. So declensions and conjugations don't scare you? Wow! We certainly have a copy of Russian Grammar by Potapova. The first sounds mechanical, or its 21st century cousin: robotic. The second is more natural because it uses custom slots, which are temporary places to store user responses. In the sample conversation 2, the chatbot extracts the key element of user's conversation (a copy of Russian Grammar by Potapova), stores it, and then uses it to craft a more colloquial reply. Custom slots can be inserted into Options-type responses to create really engaging conversations. Get Custom Slots The first step to using custom slots is to get them. The quickest way to find custom slots is to capture them when you are writing responses. On the response flow screen, start creating a new response. Toggle Set Slots to the right. Once you do it, all the user responses will be stored into temporary memory. As an admin or chatbot trainer, you can call on this memory to create dynamic responses. Use Custom Slots in Responses The prerequisite for using slots is to get the first. Ensure that you have completed the ""Get Custom Slots"" procedure first. Once again on the response flow screen, start creating a new response. Toggle Get Slots to the right. The captured slots will appear. You can copy them and insert them in your responses."
14,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Virtual-Agent/Intents.htm,Intents,"Add Intents and Utterances The thread uniting How are you today?, Hello!, Hey, fella! and Hi! is that all of them are variants on the same theme, namely ""greeting."" In the terminology of virtual agents, the variants are utterances and the theme an intent. The second step in setting up a virtual agent is to list user intents and utterances. Although a minimally functional agent can work with only four intents (greeting, goodbye, a use case, and exception handlingIt means managing an unforeseen scenario. Such as when a user starts being aggressive or cracks a joke or ask a question not related to your organization's business.), it's recommended to keep their number commensurate with use cases. If the virtual agent is going to answer to 50 kinds of queries, then the recommended number of intents is 50 + 3; the latter for greeting and bidding farewell. There are three ways to add intents: Add intents one at a time Import intents Accept SearchUnify-suggested intents Utterances are the words, phrases, and sentences customers employ to express intents. The more utterances are there in an intent, the higher are its chances of being recognized. The virtual agent needs at least five utterances for each intent to function, but it's recommended to add way more than that, which can be done in one of the three ways: Add utterances one at a time Import utterances Accept SearchUnify-suggested utterances Get to the Intents Screen From the main navigation, expand Apps and click Virtual Agent. Click to view settings. You will be on the Intents screen. Set Language Set a language the virtual agent. The utterances, intents, entities, and conversations ought to match the selected language for consistent user experience. Add Intents There are three ways to add intents. Method 1: One Intent at a Time Upon clicking Create New Intent, a dialog appears. Enter a label in the Intent Name field, a summary of what it is about in Description (60 characters), and click either Save or Save and New depending on what you intend to do next. Method 2: Add Intents in Bulk Click Import Intent and select the file where the intents are stored. Only CSV files are accepted. For the format in your CSV file, check Download Sample. Method 3: Accept SearchUnify-Suggested Intents Click Intent Suggestions. Click Move Intent. A dialog will open, click Confirm. Add an Utterance There are three ways to add an utterance. NOTE. Add as many utterances as possible. If you want to capture the intent ""HOW TO ADD A CONTENT SOURCE?"", you can add the following utterances: (1) add content source, (2) configure content source, (3) content source configuration , (4) content source addition , (5) how to add a content source, and (6) how to configure a content source. You will notice that a few keywords repeat in these utterances, such as add, configure, and content source. The repeating keywords train your virtual agent, enabling it to capture an intent from a large number of utterances with the correct keyword. Method 1. One Utterance at a Time Click on an intent. Write an utterance in the search box and press Enter. NOTE. You can insert entities in your utterances. The entities can be admin-defined (custom) or fetched from the system you're using. Here's what an intent with custom entities looks like. Method 2. Add Utterances in Bulk Click Import and select the file where the utterances are stored. Only CSV files are accepted. For the format in your CSV file, click . Method 3. Accept SearchUnify-Suggested Intents When you accept SearchUnify-suggested intent, all the utterances contained thereof are also added.

16,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Search-Clients/Create-Formula.htm,Create Formula,"Use Create Formula for Document- and Role-Based Access Control This article walks you through the Create Formula screen, starting with document-based access control which is available on all content sources and then turning to role-based access control, available only in Salesforce. For concrete examples, check out the Related section. Document-Based Access Control Restrain visibility in search results even for those content sources where role-based access control is not possible because the users aren't required to log in. The documents to go public or invisible are selected based on their field properties, such as the title, URL, author name, create date, and others. Role-Based Access Control Access restrictions on Salesforce cases, articles, and other objects are carried over to indexed files by default. If a case is out of scope for a user ID inside Salesforce console, the case remains inaccessible on the search results page as well. However, sometimes admins might want to diverge from the default settings. In such scenarios, they can use Create Formula's role-based access control. NOTE. If Salesforce is one of your content sources, then you can extend role-based access control settings with Independent Conditions to other content sources as well. Popular Use Cases Fig. 1.1 Create Formula Screen On the Content Sources screen, select a content source and a content type. Then click Create Formula. For illustration, the content source in the next image is Product Documents and the content type is Documentation. A dialog opens. On the extreme left of the dialog is a tab in light orange, which is the object Documentation. The remaining tabs in gray are content types (fields). Their number varies with the content source and the content type. In the next image, you can spot eight fields for the object Documentation, namely Body, Category, Content, Created Date, Heading, Last Updated, Title, and URL. Document-based access control can be applied either on: Entire objects Individual content fields Let's say your goal is to change visibility settings of Documents based on a document's created date. For that, click Created Date. A dialog will open in which two fields are of interest to us: Action Name is where access control settings are labeled. Prefer descriptive labels. For demonstration, ""Exclude May 2021"" has been chosen. Our goal is to hide all the documents created in the month of May 2021 from the search results page. Add Conditions. User personas in Add Conditions support only Salesforce. Scroll down to User-Based Access Control to learn about them. Response is where field values are selected. The idea of picking field values can seem tricky at first but once grasped, you will find it intuitive. Here are two examples: GOAL: Hide all the articles written by Jose Saramago. Here article is an object, author name is a field, and Jose Saramago is an author name value. The field author name can take other values as well, such as Naguib Mahfouz, Fyodor Dostoevsky, or Michel de Montaigne. But we want the action of hiding articles described in Map Rules into Formula and Formula Field Mapping (next sections) to take place only when author name has a specific value (Jose Saramago). GOAL. Don't show any article drafts to external users. Article is an object, article state is a field and in article state == draft, the field value is draft. Users are another object and user type is a field. In our case, user type == external. The goal is to hide all drafts from external users which is possible in Map Rules into Formula and Formula Field Mapping. Illustration GOAL: Hide the documents created in May, 2021. Documentation is an object (Fig. 1.3) and Created Date is a field (Fig. 1.3). May, 2021 is a value of the field Created Date. We click Created Date and a new dialog opens (Fig. 1.4). Because the goal is to hide documents, we give our action a descriptive name in Action Name. In Response, we select the date range. Fig. 1.4 When you click Save, the dialog resembles the next image. In the left section, Rules, a row has appeared. All we have done so far is specify that we want an action to occur when field value is something. What that action is going to be is specified in Map Rules into Formula or Formula Field Mapping using the following four operators. Operators Four operators are available. AND. Boolean operator. Used to select two or more field values. AND (Val1, Val2, Val3) returns only those documents which have all of these three field values. OR. Boolean operator. Used to make a selection between two or more field values. OR (Val1, Val2, Val3) returns all the documents which have any of these three field values. NOT. Boolean operator. Used to exclude documents with specified field values from results. NOT (Val1) excludes all the documents with the field value Val1. REGEX.Interpret the field value as a regular expression. It is useful when a field is, let's say, view_href and you want to go public with or remove access to URLs from a specific host. Or when the field is title and you don't want any document with the word ""archived"" in it. Rules List The formula are essentially Action Names with Response values. Once created, they are available for use on any content source and across all search clients. We have so far created only one Formula: Exclude May, 2021. Map Rules into Formula Map Rules into Formula offers a board where you can use Operators and Rules to define a formula. When at least one rule is created, the operator node starts showing up on the Map Rules into Formula Board. In the next image, you can see a simple formula, where all the articles created in May, 2021 are excluded from search results. To start with, we will select NOT from the Operator dropdown. Click ICON, then from Add Rule, select Exclude May 2021. Click Check Syntax and then Save. Formula (Expression) Formula Expression is an alternative way to write formulas. Instead of a configuring a GUI, you write a explicit formula. To obtain the same result that we have achieved through Map Rule Into Formula, write NOT(Exclude May 2021) in Formula (Expression), click Check Index, and then Save. Both Formula (Expression) and Map Rule Into Formula are two alternative methods to obtain identical results. Fig. 1.6 Role-Based Access Control (Salesforce) Role-based access control is solely available for Salesforce content sources. Instead of an admin specifying explicitly, Responses are picked based on certain user properties. The entire process has three steps, as opposed to two in document-based access control. The extra step is Add Conditions, which can be completed in three parts: Define User Properties Select an Operator Write a condition Each of the steps is explained next. User Properties Six user properties are supported: UserId UserType AccountId ProfileId ContactId PermissionSet Fig. 1.7 Operators The user properties are then compared with values using operators, of which six are available. Equals: Equation is true when User Property equals to the specified value. Not Equals: Equation is true when User Property is not equal to the specified value. And: Equation is true when two or more User Properties are true. OR: Equation is true at least of the User Properties is true. Includes: Equation is true when a User Property includes the specified value. Dependency in: Equation is true when a User Property equals the Response value of another Action. Fig. 1.8 Conditions With user properties and operators, you can create simple as well as complex creations. One simple condition is in the next image which hides the documents created in May 2021 only to External users. It's entirely identical to the previous condition, except that User Type is defined. Next either through Map Rules Into Formula or Formula (Expression), obtain the equivalent of NOT(Exclude May 2021). Fig. 1.10 Independent Conditions Independent Conditions are used to extend role-based access control settings, based on Salesforce, to other content sources. Example An organization uses Salesforce Community and another to host docs, let's say Confluence. It wants to hide a document, Bug Fixes: 2021-12-04, on Confluence from external users. Document-based access control would have sufficed if the goal was to hide it from all the users. But that's not the case here. We want everyone, but external users, to be able to find the document. However, access control based on a user's profile is available only in Salesforce. It's exactly for such situations that Independent Conditions offers a way out. The following example shows how you can hide a Confluence document based on its title from external users. The users are identified from Salesforce data. Open a search client, connected with both Confluence and Salesforce Community, for editing. Next go to Content Sources, find Salesforce Community, click Create Formula, and then Independent Conditions. Give the condition a descriptive title in Action Name. In Add Condition, set User.UserType == External. Finally, insert True in Response. Save the settings. Then open the Confluence content source. In our case, the content source is named Docs Site. NOTE. Although this example is about Confluence, the same steps can be applied to any content source other than Salesforce. Next, give the action a name, select Equals from Operator and choose Hide from External (the independent condition from Salesforce Community) from Dependency. In Response, write the title of the document that has to be hidden. Here's a summary of what's happening here: Hide Bug Fixes Doc (Confluence) calls Hide From External (Salesforce Community Independent Condition) Hide From External (Salesforce Community Independent Condition) returns True if the user is External When the condition is True, Hide Bug Fixes Doc (Confluence) returns Bug Fixes: 2021-12-04 from Response Voilà! We have just applied user-based access control on a non-Salesforce platform with Independent Conditions. Related Example 1: Hide a Document Based on Its URL"

What is true of the URL field is applicable on other fields as well so that if you learn how to remove from results a document with a specific URL, you will also learn how to remove documents based on their Title, Description, Tag, and any indexed field. For illustration, we hide the top result from a Salesforce Communities search client. Because the top result is from a StackOverflow content source, open StackOverflow 30K (label could be different in your instance) and then Question. Click Create Formula. Because the goal is to hide a document based on its URL, we have to drag the field storing web addresses to the gray area. In our case, the field is view_href. In the dialog that has appeared, copy the document URL (the one that is to be removed) into Response. Give this activity a name in Action Name and click Save. Now that we have stored data (web address) in a field (view_href), the next task is to decide what to do with the data. For that scroll down to Formula Field Mapping. To hide a document based on a field value, select NOT from the Operators dropdown. NOT() will appear inside the gray box. Move cursor by one to the left so that it's between the parenthesis of NOT() and then pick an Action Name from List of Formula Save your settings. Refresh the page. Example 1 Notes It's possible to create complex visibility conditions using the other operators: AND, OR, and REGEX. For instance, you can write a formula of the type AND(URL1, URL2, URL3, NOT(URL4 OR URL5)) which translates into: Show all of URL1, URL2, and URL3 but not URL4 and URL5. AND and OR are Boolean but REGEX interprets the value in Response as a regular expression. NOT(REGEX(Exclude_StackOverflow)) will hide all remove all the documents hosted on StackOverflow.

You can make them more useful by grouping similar facets together. For example, an organization with multiple knowledge bases can divide its content sources into Official (where only the employees contribute) and Community (where customers can participate). Another use case is tag management. A large content source can have thousands of tags. You can bring some sanity to them by clubbing them into a handful of categories that are more manageable. Grouping Facets Go to Search Clients and click to open edit settings for a search client. Navigate to Content Sources. Click to open Merge Facets settings. The facet categories detected by SearchUnify or created by an admin are in the leftmost Facets column. Drag one facet to the second column, Selected Facets. Click the selected facet and then Subgroup your facets and give the subgroup a name. In the diagram below, the three tags have been clubbed together and the name merge facets. Check Yes if you want to show child facets, and No if you want to keep them hidden. Checking Yes If you check Yes, your search client users will see a mother facet, merge facet, and three child facets, startup, office, and wework. Checking No If you check No, the users will only see merge facet. Click Save. The window will close. Click Save again. And finally click Save to preserve your settings.

38,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/FAQs/Results-Sorting.htm,How Documents Are Ranked in SearchUnify,"How Documents Are Ranked in SearchUnify Once the relevant documents have been found, the next challenge is to sort them. SearchUnify considers more than a dozen factors before returning results in any particular order to a user. They have all been touched upon in this article. Preliminary Sorting The processed search terms are matched with the index using Lucene's search and sort algorithm. The best matches are found based on the formula, which has the following variables: Term Frequency (). How often the query () appears in a document (). Inverse Document Frequency (). How often appears across the index (). Coord. Number of terms in that are found in . lengthNorm. Importance of in . queryNorm. A variable to compare queries. Boost (Index). Boost at the time of indexing. Boost (Query). Boost at the time of query building. Advanced Sorting The mapped documents are further ranked based on a proprietary algorithm. The variables in the algorithm include: Relevance Documents with the highest score are likely to end up near the top. Activity History Auto Tuning plays a big role here. If it's turned on, then user activity history is taken into account in deciding how the relevant documents will be ranked. The search results for a user might be different from another user. For details, check out How Auto Tuning Works and Its Features Search Tuning Settings .Three tuning configurations are available to SearchUnify admins: Keyword Tuning. Assign a document any rank between 1 and 10 for a query or a series. You cannot put two or more documents the same rank for a query; document-1 and document-2 cannot have the same rank for query. However, you can return a document on the same rank for one or multiple queries; document can have the same rank for query-1 and query-2. A setting in keyword tuning overrules all other factors and returns the document on its assigned rank. Check out Boost Documents for Specific Keywords Content Source Tuning .Unlike moving one document up or down at a time, admins can boost all the documents in a content source with content source tuning. Content boosting increases the default relevancy score of all documents. In the images, you can see what happens when a StackOverflow is boosted as a content source. Boost All Documents in a Content Source Field Tuning Supported fields are a document's title, its status, age, and popularity. An admin can alter the default emphasis on each field. For instance, a keyword match in the title can boost a document's relevancy score twice, thrice, or more. In the images, you can see the impact of title boosting for the keyword ""unavailability."" Custom Tuning: Boost Articles Based on Keyword Match in a Field Publishing Date Recent documents are preferred over older docs. Parameters Offset. The period during which the score of a newly updated document doesn't change. Scale. Once Offset has passed, begins to drop. It continues to drop for a time period, known as Scale. Decay [Rate]. The rate of drop of relevance score during Scale is controlled by Decay Rate, Example. A search for ‘pyramid construction’ before and after the creation of a new doc. The new doc is prioritized in the second image. NOTE. Some search queries activate SearchUnify's machine learning algorithms. As a result, a user receives up to 15 (instead of the usual 10) results. Machine learning algorithms fetch those extra results by applying facets and autocorrecting some search terms. Related Previous article: How Queries Are Transformed During Search"

SearchUnify is a single-tenant solution. Each customer has their own independent instance of SearchUnify, which secures their index. Does SearchUnify store any data in middleware? SearchUnify stores encrypted access/refresh tokens for content sources (Lithium, Salesforce, Jive etc.). These credentials are stored to synchronize the content in the SearchUnify index. How does SearchUnify ensure that the content sources’ authentication information is secure? All the authentication access tokens/refresh tokens stored in the middleware are encrypted using AES-256 encryption algorithm. Which content objects will be accessed by SearchUnify? It depends upon what content needs to be made searchable via SearchUnify. For example, in a Lithium community, SearchUnify supports searching ideas, discussions, blogs etc. So, these content pieces will be stored in the search index. Which API is used to connect with the content sources? SearchUnify uses the standard platform REST APIs on SSL for all the content sources. For websites, Apache-based crawlers are used to crawl the websites and index the content.

44,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/NLP-Manager/Taxonomy.htm,Taxonomy,"Taxonomy Content Annotation in Content Sources is used to categorize content sources data into predefined categories. For example, in a community with a million threads on 50 products, you can use Content Annotation to tag threads with product names. The tags can then be used as filters to improve user experience. To find discussions on a product, a searcher can simply select the product name from a facet. While tagging is automatic, specifying the content source, objects and fields to be tagged is the SU Admin's job. It is also the Admin who defines the tags. An Admin can specify 50 tags for a community of a million threads or 100 tags for a community of only 10000 threads. To learn how to specify a content sources for automated text tagging, check out Automatic Text Classification with Content Annotation. This article explains the process of defining: Values. Tags used for annotating content sources. For example, product names are values. Entities. Clusters of values. For example, all product names can be clustered into an entity Products. Insert Entities and Values in Taxonomy Navigate to NLP Manager and click Taxonomy. Click Add Entity. Values used for content source data annotation are grouped as Entities. For example, a list of all product names can be stored into an entity Products and a list of all problems can be stored in an entity Issues.

46,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Content-Sources/RSS.htm,Index RSS Feeds,"Index RSS Feeds The easiest way to search through RSS feeds content is to link the feeds to SearchUnify RSS Crawler. Once linked, SearchUnify indexes the content as soon as it appears. You can limit indexing to the latest batch or keep all content in the index. Up to twelve content fields are supported, including links, descriptions, and titles. Establish a Connection Navigate to Content Sources. Click Add new content source. Find RSS through the search box and click Add. One or multiple RSS feeds are indexed as a content source, which requires a name. Give it a descriptive appellation in Name. Each RSS feed has a URL, usually ending in .rss or .xml. Enter the one or multiple URLs in Client URL. If you are entering multiple URLs, use commas to separate them. Select the content language in Language. You can select multiple languages if your RSS feed content is in more than one language. English is selected by default. Let's assume that you obtain 100 articles from all your RSS feeds in everyday. In a year, you will have an index of 36500 articles. Turn on Retain Historical Data in the Index if you want to search through all these 36500 after a year. Keep it turned off if you want to limit search to the 100 latest articles. Frequency The settings in Frequency have no impact on the RSS Crawler. The index is updated on how frequency RSS feed streams in new content. Rules Rules allow you to define the RSS content fields to be indexed. A total of 12 content fields are supported: Channel Title, Channel Description, Channel Link, Channel LastBuildDate, Language, Item GUID, Item Title, Item Description, Item Category, Item Link, Item Published Date, and Comments. For example, if you add only Channel Title, then you cannot look up an article through its URL. For this reason, it's recommended to index all the fields. That makes search experience seamless. To start with, write Items in Object and Label and click Add. Open Items for editing and add all the supported fields: Channel Title, Channel Description, Channel Link, Channel LastBuildDate, Language, Item GUID, Item Title, Item Description, Item Category, Item Link, Item Published Date, and Comments. Save the settings. Return to Content Sources and run a manual crawl. If the number count in Documents edges upwards, you have successfully configured RSS field(s) for indexing."

Set Up Crawl Frequency The first crawl is always manual. Click Set and move to the next section. After the First Crawl In Choose a Date, click to fire up a calendar and select a date. Only the Salesforce objects created or updated after the selected date is indexed. Use the Frequency dropdown to select how often SearchUnify should index the Salesforce objects in your instance.. For illustration, the frequency has been set to Weekly the Tuesday has been chosen as the crawling day. Whenever the Frequency is other than Never, a third dropdown appears where you can specify the interval. Click Set to save crawl frequency settings. On clicking Set, you are taken to the Rules tab. Select Content Fields for Indexing Starting C21, two Appenium objects, ViewTrac and LearnTrac, are supported out-of-the-box. The content is shown to the searchers according to the permissions defined using the Media sharing rules under Appinium. We need to assign permission sets for objects to the user accordingly. In LearnTrac app, permissions are set on the document level. So, if there's any change made on permissions then a manual crawl is required. Frequency crawl doesn't get the updates for permissions change. (this is because Last modified date is not updated there when sharing permissions are updated). You can decide which object fields are indexed. SearchUnify supports standard and custom object fields. To selection a object, enter its Object API name. The list of valid object API names can be found in the second column of Object Manager. (Log into Salesforce to view.) NOTE. SearchUnify supports the indexing of record fields as well. You might want to crawl them if your knowledge base is hosted on a Salesforce org. To index article drafts, use enter knowledge__kav_draft in the Object API field. In order to crawl the feeditem object, add a network scope condition first. When adding fields, you can try adding new objects instead. A big advantage of object crawl is that it's safer. When an object crawl fails, the overall index isn't impacted. Add Object will become clickable if the name API name is valid. Otherwise you will receive a warning. After entering a valid API name, enter a label and click Add Object. After adding the objects, the next task is to select object fields (content fields) for indexing. Click to select a content field. Advanced users can add properties—such as createdDate and accountDescription—one at a time. They can further change a property's label, type, and searchability. For everyone else, the safest option is to click Add all and Save. Repeat the previous step with all the objects and press Save. You have successfully added Salesforce as a content source. Manage Archived Articles Archived articles are automatically removed from the SU index if the archiving rate is less than 200 articles per hour. However, if the archiving rate in your org exceeds that limit and you don't want the archived articles to be searchable, place a request with your CSM to delete the extraneous articles. Crawl Attachments Files in Salesforce are stored in an object named contentdocument. The files can be linked to objects, such as case, knowledge, and feeds. You can turn your files searchable in two ways. In the first method, the files appear as independent search results. End-users can see sample-file.pdf and sample-file.doc in results after searching sample-file. In the second method, the files don't appear in results but the object they are attached with turn up in results.

A use case can be to boost Salesforce Knowledge Articles on a Help Center and Salesforce Cases for in a Salesforce Console search client. Activate Field Match. Extremely powerful tool. Let's say a document has three components: title, body, and author. On applying Content Field Boosting on author, you can boost all the documents in which author value equals the user search query. The details are in the section Boost a Content Field. To increase the probability of documents from one or more content sources appearing more frequently in search, navigate to the Content Based tab in Search Tuning and then perform the following steps. Select a Search Client for Manual Tuning Manual Tuning is not universal. You can apply is to one search client without making having any impact on others. To get started, pick the search client where tuning is going to be applied. From Search Tuning, go to Manual. Select a search client where Manual Tuning is going to be applied. When there are multiple search clients in a SearchUnify instance and your job is to apply manual tuning to only one of them, you can bookmark your search client by clicking in the Select Search Client dropdown. Boost a Content Type Boosting a content type improves the visibility of all documents in the object. In Content, toggle Content Boosting to the right to Enable it. You can now see a list of the content sources and content types linked with the search client. Boost a content type. The greater the value, the higher the probability of documents in a content type to appear on top. In the illustration, two content types have been boosted: Case and Article. Boost a Content Field Content field boosting works on the principle of keyword match. You can boost the title field of object documentation, but that will not lead to an improved rank for all files in documentation with a title. For content field boosting to work, the field must be searchable and the search query must be identical or similar to the boosted field. Click to expand a content type to view the content fields. In the image, you can spot three content fields, case number, description, and subject, in the content type Case. Assign a value to each content field. In the image, subject has been set to 9.9. In such a case, when a user looks up ""set up SearchUnify"", the files whose titles contain the query are boosted. For example, the documents with titles, such as ""How to set up SearchUnify?"" and ""SearchUnify Set Up Issues"", will be boosted for the query but the other cases with titles—such as ""Salesforce and Lithium compared""—will not be boosted. To undo field boosting, set the boosting value to zero. Field match gives a more powerful boost to a document than content type boost, even for the subject field. When a subject has been boosted is both Custom and Content, then the latter takes precedence."
28,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Search-Tuning/Enable-Auto-Boosting.htm,Enable Auto Boosting,"Enable Auto Boosting Enable Auto Boosting brings the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to search. When turned on, it transforms a search client by making it more personal. Some examples of personalization include: Custom ranking based on search activity. Past user activity has a high correlation with what the user wants to see in the future. Someone partial to community posts will find more of them in search results as opposed to another who prefers KB articles. Relevancy based on user role. API documentation and developer docs can be ranked higher for a developer and user guides and use case document for someone in the marketing team. Personalized and Secure Users get results tailored to their needs, irrespective of whether they are logged in or not. A clever technique to store user activity data forming the basis of tailor-made results in users' browsers, instead of someone's cloud, makes it possible. Users can literally keep their data on their devices and still keep the advantages that AI affords. As for the admins, no one has to worry about making changes to their open knowledge base or website. Personalized Search from Day X Because user activity is one of the biggest factors influencing personalized search, the right time to turn on Auto Tuning is when your employees and customers have already been using SearchUnify for at least a few weeks. Although the exact time will vary by organization and search volume, a rule of the thumb is to wait for 10-12 weeks. The waiting period will prevent any early biases from taking root. Enable Auto Boosting Select a search client where auto boosting will be applied. To auto-pick a search client each time you navigate to Search Tuning, click to bookmark it. Toggle Enable Auto Boosting to the right turn it on. Click OK if a pop-up asks you: ""Are you sure you want to enable Auto Boosting?"" Opt Out In case a user doesn't prefer personalized results, they can simply opt out by refusing to accept cookies from the platform where the search client is installed, deleting browser cache, or switching to private browsing. It's even easier for admins who can turn off auto tuning for all search client users at once by toggling Enable Auto Boosting to the left. Go to Search Tuning > Auto, and turn off Enable Auto Boosting."

A big difference being, Virtual Agent works 24x7 and never asks for a sick leave. The app is highly configurable. It can be designed to help users buy airplane tickets, log cases, reserve a table in a restaurant, and pretty much everything that can be translated into conversations. The configurations range from the name of the bot to chat window design. Once you have identified your business goals, a functional virtual agent can be deployed in a matter of a few hours. The harder part is to create stories around use cases. We will come to that later. For now, let's create a virtual agent. Virtual Agents Screen The first step to adding a virtual agent is to expand Apps and click Virtual Agent and then Add a New Agent. Add New Agent Dialog Clicking Add a New Agent opens a dialog, Add New Agent. There are six fields on the dialog: Select Search Client.

Welcome Message. Once you have settled on a name, you can proceed to write the opening message, which can be a light-hearted greeting, such as Comment ça va ?, or a professional offer to help, such as the one seen in the next image.

32,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Virtual-Agent/Entities.htm,Entities,"Create Entities for Use in Intents and Responses Intent match is the first step to getting things done. Once you have figured out what your users are saying, the challenge is to dive into the specifics. Why Use Entities Assuming you have installed a virtual agent on your support community, a user might interact with it for several reasons. The top ones tend to be: Check a ticket's status Log a ticket Talk to a support rep Find an article Consider the first intent ""check a ticket's status."" What do you do next once it has been identified? The obvious answer is to respond with a progress report and it's as easy as it sounds if you have only one ticket in your entire system; in which case you will probably not be using a virtual agent. In case your organization has more business, more clients, and more tickets, your virtual agent trainer is left with two options: Every time a new ticket is logged, create an utterance with its ID and group it with other utterances in the intent ""check a ticket's status"" so that if the user returns to find out the status of their ticket, your virtual agent can detect the ticket ID and answer accordingly. Use entities to extract ticket IDs each time ""check a ticket's status"" is spotted. The first method is great if you have eons at your disposal and loads of free money and no fear of losing business. The second is the approach most readers will agree with because it far easier to create an entity TICKETID and let it extract information from an intent than generate a horde of utterances differing only in a number. And that brings us to the definition of an entity. An entity is an collection of related values with a name. The values can be numbers, such as number of people going on a vacation; time, such as days of the month or week; and/or strings, such as crust of a pizza or the type of a car. The information can be of several kinds. A ticket ID can be a long string of digits, sometimes punctuated by alphabets. A date can also be an entity and so can be a customer name. SearchUnify supports them all. Supported Entity Types Entities in SearchUnify are of two kinds. System Entities There are four of them. sys.number. To identify and extract numbers from an utterance. Examples: My phone number is 23491323. He is 27 years old. system.date. To identify and extract a date from an utterance. Examples: I logged a ticket on 24 January, 2020. Since May 17, 2020, there has been no response from your company. system.date.month. To identify and extract a month from an utterance. Examples: I logged 10 tickets in July. There must be some cheap flights to Bethlehem in September. sys.date.year. To identify and extract a year from an utterance. Examples: The data breach occurred in 2019. Can you completing the construction of my house before 2022? Custom Entities Then comes the singular custom entity which is used to extract specific keywords from an utterance. Let's assume that you sell pizzas. Depending on the crust, cheese, and other ingredients used, the variety available of cooked pizzas is infinite. However, each ingredient has only a few types. In such scenario, you can create an entity out of each ingredient and insert each type of that ingredient as a value. Entity Values Cheese Mozzarella, Cheddar, Harvarti, Gorgonzola, Provolone, Pecorino Crust Thin, Flatbread, Thick, Focaccia, Stuffed, Neapolitan In case a customer asks for ""a flatbread pizza with gorgonzola"", then your virtual agent can extract the correct cheese and crust type. Let's Not Forget Synonyms If an entity groups related values then Synonyms captures the variations on each value. What can a customer in need do? Should he log a ticket? Or probably a complaint? Or probably a case? Or probably... you get it. Complaint, case, and ticket are variations on the same theme: a formal request for help. As an admin, you can create an entity by the name of help and set complaint, case, and ticket its synonyms. ' Enough of theory. In the next section, you will learn to create and import entities. Create Entities From the main navigation, expand Apps and click Virtual Agent. Click to view settings. Open the Entities tab. Click Create New Entity. In the dialog that has opened, give a name to your entity and mention the values that will be part of this group. You don't have to be thorough because you can always expand the group or contract it by removing values. Click Save. Your entity should be in the list. Remove or Add Values from Entities In case you realize that you have added a value that you don't really need or you entity can benefit from more values, you can do that with a click. On the entities screen, click . Use Backspace to remove values and/or enter new values from your keyboard. Use commas to separate values. Click SAVE to save your new group.

At the same time, there is no reason to stop at that when more innovative ways to measure conversation relevancy without bothering users are available. Settings in Analytics offers non-intrusive ways to gather feedback. From Settings, you can start a feedback loop and find a way to constantly improve experience for users and your company. Settings offers four ways to gather feedback. When multiple successful parameter in Settings are enabled, then the failure of any parameter causes the entire conversation to be unsuccessful. In the image, Zero Feedbacks and Zero Coverage are enabled. For a conversation to be successful, an end-user has to give feedback and find stories for all their utterances. If either condition fails, the conversation isn't successful. Zero Feedback PREREQUISITE User Feedback should be turned on. Check out the last section in Story Board and User Feedback for configuration instructions. Extremely useful when User Feedback has been turned on, any conversation with one or more feedback is considered successful. Zero Feedback User Leaves a Feedback Conversation Turned On Yes Successful Turned On No Unsuccessful Turned Off Yes No impact Turned Off No No impact Zero Coverage PREREQUISITE Zero Coverage works only when there is at least one story. When it's turned on and at least once during a whole conversation, the user writers or enters an utterance for which a story is available, then the conversation is successful. Zero Coverage Action Conversation Turned On A story is found for at least one utterance. Successful Turned On No story is found for all utterances Unsuccessful Turned Off A story is found for at least utterance No impact Turned Off No story is found for all utterances No impact Case or Discussion Created through Virtual Agent PREREQUISITE Enable responses for at least one story. Else, the option remains disabled. Along with Handover to Live Agent, this toggle is probably the simplest to grasp. When Case or Discussion Created through Virtual Agent is turned on, and an end-user starts a new thread on your community or raises a ticket, then the conversation is unsuccessful. Handover to Live Agent When Handover to Live Agent is turned on, and an end-user requests to be connected with a human agent, the conversation becomes unsuccessful. The key here is the end-user intention. The moment the end-user clicks ""Connects Me to Agent"", the conversation becomes unsuccessful. The actual connection might not happen because of connectivity or other issues. Nonetheless, that doesn't prevent the conversation from becoming unsuccessful."

38,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Search-Clients/Configure-the-Content-Sources.htm,Configure the Content Sources,"Configure Content Sources Linked to a Search Client Adding and installing a search client are essential but certainly not sufficient to set up a search. The Edit function completes the trinity. In Edit, the Content Sources is arguably the most important tab. It is here that you can connect content sources and search clients and configure almost everything that goes onto the search results page, including facets, URLs, icons, and how data from content sources is used. Content Sources provides many options for working with the content sources connected to a search client. This article explains the content fields (object properties) screen. To learn about features, consult the links in Related. Get to Content Sources For instances hosting more than a search client, an instance manager needs to configure content sources for each search client individually. FromSearch Clients, open a search client for configuration. Go to Content Sources. You will not find any content fields if your search client is new and you're editing for the first time. To view the content fields, click on a content source and then a content type (object). In the next image, content type ""Case"" in content source ""Anjali 45"" has been opened. Content Fields and Columns There are all the indexed content fields and seven columns on the screen. Next is explained what checking a content field in a column entails. Summary The first column. The checked fields appear in result summaries. For instance, if you check Description, then the value stored in ""Description"" will be in summary whenever a document from Anjali 45 > Case is on the search results page. It's possible to return only one or multiple fields in search results summaries. In the default setup, multiple values appear one after another until the maximum summary length is reached. This behavior can be changed fromSet Default Preferences. Searchable The data in a content source cannot be looked up from the search box unless you explicitly make it searchable. A quick way to make the data in a content field findable is to check the field in the Searchable column. In the image, both X and Y can be looked up but if anyone tries to find a case by its ID, they will fail because the case ID field has not been made searchable. Facets Facets are the clickable menus generally seen on the left of search results. They allow users to narrow the scope of a search. For instance, someone clicking the value ""Dostoevsky"" in the facet ""Author"" will find documents written by Dostoevsky. Tags and time fields generally make great facets. To see any field as a facet, check it in the Facets column. Immediately after checking, a dialog with two dropdowns will open. Select how many facet values are to be visible on a search client in Number of Values. From the second dropdown, select facet sorting. Four sorting schemes are available: Alphabetical (A-Z). Display all the facets alphabetically. Alphabetical (Z-A). Display all the facets in reverse alphabetical order. Count (desc). Display the facet value with the most results for a query at top. This is the default setting. Count (asc). Display the facet value with the least results for a query at top. Sorting is applied to all the facet values, not just the visible ones. Title The checked fields appear in the result titles on a search results page. As with Summary, it is possible to check multiple fields to assemble a Title. Metadata The supplementary information sometimes accompanying search results is Metadata. It has a uniform appearance: {{field name}}: {{field value}}. If you check Created Date in the Metadata column, you will see ""Created Data: 2021-01-01"" (some date) below summary on each result from Anjali 14 > Case. Autocomplete SearchUnify throws suggestions when you are typing in the search box. You can decide which fields those suggestions will come from. For instance, if you check Title in Autocomplete, then someone looking for a case from its title will get a suggestion. Exclude Exclude is connected with Facets. When a field is picked as a facet, a button for that field appears in Exclude. CAPTION: When X is selected as a facet, the Exclude button appears for X. Click the button and enter all the facet values that you want to hide. If there are three values in Tags: Python, JavaScript, and C++ and you enter Python in Exclude Bucket Values, then there will remain visible only two tags on the search client: JavaScript and C++.

Fig. 1 Each row in the Content Sources column can be mapped with the facet category Sources category on your search client. Fig 2 On clicking a content source, you can discover which content type is most commonly used as a filter. Some content sources store multiple content types, such as Salesforce and Paligo Docs, but others, such as a website, have only one. In Fig. 3, you can spot multiple content types and in Fig. 4, only one. The content source is on the top left. NOTE. The sum of Clicks in the second column will be rarely equal to the clicks received by a content source. The reason lies in the different ways the clicks are measured. In the case of content sources, any click on a document hosted on that content source increases the Clicks count. In case of content types, only those clicks are counted in which a Content Type is selected as a filter. The same is true of Content Fields and Content Field values. Fig. 3 Fig. 4 Further clicking on the content type, shows which content fields are being selected the most. Documentation Type is a commonly selected field (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 On the search client, Documentation Type will have its own category. Fig. 6 A click on a content field (Fig. 7) tells you which content field values are being selected the most. Fig. 7 Developer Guides should be a value in the category (content field) Documentation Type. Fig. 8 Related Other reports in Conversions."
2,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Search-Analytics/Search-Report.htm,Search Report,"Search Report Search Report lists end-user queries on search clients. The queries are divided into four sub-reports: All Searches. It displays a list of all the 50 latest queries looked up on a search client. To dig deeper, use pagination. Successful Searches (Clicks). It is a list of queries which returned at least one result and at least one of the results is clicked. Searches with no Click. It is a list of queries for which results are found but not clicked. This data assists content managers identify documents whose titles and summaries can be rewritten to improve perceived relevancy. Searches with no Result. Search queries for which no result is produced. A search can be no-result for multiple reasons: Documents with the search keywords do not exist in your data repositories The user does not have the permission to see documents. Your search client is not connected with the content source where the documents are stored. Sub-report Metrics Each sub-report has four metrics. Searches with No Result is the sole exception with five metrics. Next, the table outlines the metrics. The table on the right has a searchable and three sortable columns: № Column Displays Extra Functions 1 Query Search queries. Example. At least one user searched react, analytics, content sources, and search client. You can find a query in this column through the built-in search function. 2 Users Number of unique devices (browsers) from which search queries occur. Example: Four unique users searched react and 6 unique users searched search client. The column is sortable. 3 Sessions Number of search sessions in which the queries occur. Example. Four unique users searched react in 8 different sessions and 6 unique users searched search client in 6 different sessions. The column is sortable. You can find the ID of each session. Example. content sources has been searched in 4 different sessions. To find the ID of each session, click 4. The dialog changes and you see a four-table column with the session IDs, the email of the user who searched the query (only for Internal users), and the time of search. The Session ID and Email columns are searchable. The Last Search column is sortable. 4 Searches Number of times search queries repeat. Example. Four unique users searched react 10 times in 8 different sessions, six unique users searched search client 6 times in 6 different sessions, and only one user searched analytics 9 times in one session. This column is sortable. You can find out if what facets and advanced search operators are used with a query by clicking Searches. Example. analytics has been searched 9 times. Click 9 in Searches. A dialog opens where you can see the facets or advanced search operators applied. Documentation in Source Object has been used 2 times, Tutorials in Source Object has been used 2 times, Content Source in Discourse Topics has been used 2 times, and the remaining facets once each. Advanced Search operators haven't been used. So you see NULL. 5 Action (only for Searches with No Result) What has been done to address zero results queries. Example. New content is required for python and someone has already made the changes to prevent Agent and product from being zero-result searches again. The column is visible only when a search client has been specified in Select Search Client. The column has eight filters, All and the following seven: Pending (). The default status. Each search query with zero results is set to Pending. In Progress (). An SU admin can change the status to In Progress when work has started on creating content or configuring tuning for the query. Update Content (). An SU admin can change the status to Update Content, when existing content needs editing to avoid zero results for the query again. New Content (). An SU admin can change the status to New Content, when new content needs to be written to avoid zero results for the query again. Add Synonyms (). An SU admin can change the status to Add Synonyms, when NLP Manager needs to be configured to avoid zero results for the query again. No Action Required (). An SU admin can change the status to No Action Required, either the query return zero results because of a temporary hitch or nothing can be done to prevent zero results again. The latter can happen when a user looks up information on medicine on a video games website. Completed (). An SU admin can change the status to Completed when the changes to prevent zero results for the query have been done. From , an SU admin can apply filters to find queries with a specific action taken. Example. To find queries that new content, select New Content. NOTE. Filters are reset each time an SU Admin logs out, change the search client, or picks a new date range. Navigating inside the instance or refreshing the page through F5 has no impact on filter selection. Download or Share Check out Download and Share an Analytics Report NOTE. The downloaded or share reports for each classification are CSV files. Each CSV file consists of five columns: Search Query, Search ID, Facet Type, Facet Value, and #Searches, of which only Search ID is new. (#Search is the synonym of Count here.) A user can apply multiple facets in a search query. Because each Facet Type and Facet Value occupies its own row, the Search ID helps readers immediately see which queries spread over multiple rows are essentially one. In the next image, row 4 and 5 refer to the same query because their Search ID is identical. A report can contain data for up to 5,000 search queries. Related Back to Overview"
3,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Search-Analytics/Searches-with-No-Result.htm,Searches with No Result,"Searches with No Result Searches for which results are not shown. The Searches with No Result report carries context now. Instead of simply listing the keywords for which no documents were found, the report will provide details, such as whether any ﬁlters were in use and what search operators were employed. Based on this information, admins can select the best course of action to plug content gaps: Create new article or educate users about advanced search. A search can be no-result for multiple reasons: Documents with the search keywords do not exist in your data repositories. The user does not have the permission to see documents. Your search client is not connected with the content source where the documents are stored. Further to assist content teams, this report captures Successive Searches with clicks which helps to understand the user journey. These successive searches could be made by the users as an alternative to unsuccessful search queries (no results produced). In the latter searches, user could have found a useful document and Admin might want to boost the same document for the unsuccessful search query. For example: 13 users have searched for the keyword ‘data’ 80 times in their 17 sessions, but no results were produced. On the right, 5 searches were made which gave relevant results that users end up clicking on the search results.

6,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Home/Home.htm,Home,"Getting to Know Your SearchUnify Dashboard Home is an abridged story of search on your website, community, or another platform. The story is told through four tiles—Total Searches, With Searches, Clicks, and Conversions—and three sections: Live Streaming, Analytics Overview, and Recommendations. Each section or tile covers a key part of search experience, including: How popular search is among your employees and customers, how useful search clients are, where the searchers are from, and what you can do to enhance search experience for everyone. Navigation Panel The Navigation Panel provides access to the SearchUnify features that an admin needs to index a content source, set up search, monitor analytics, and everyday administration. The modules used most often are a click away. They include: Home, Content Sources, Search Clients, Search Analytics, Search Tuning, NLP Manager, and API. The last two modules are customizable. Clicking Apps takes you to the Apps Store where you can install new programs on your instance to extend its functionality. The added programs can be viewed by expanding Apps. Administration houses three modules used in instance management: Security, Manage Users, and Alerts. Four-Tiles Ribbon The Four-Tiles Ribbon displays the cumulative data on four metrics from all your search clients. The metrics are: Total Searches, With Results, Clicks, and Conversions. Total Searches Total Searches reports the sum of searches performed on all your search clients and requested through your Search API. If you have 7 search clients and 3 Search API users, then Total Searches will combine their usage statistics into one aggregated figure. With Results With Results is defined as the sum of searches which produced at least one result. The search can be through a search client or via the Search API. With Results is obtained by subtracting Unsuccessful Searches from Total Searches. Clicks Clicks stands for the total number of times users across all your search clients opened results. One search query can produce more than one clicks. Conversions Conversions is the ratio of Clicks to With Results. Consider the simplest scenario: You have only one search client and that search client has only one user. That user runs a query and finds results 50 times but clicks on any of the result only 20 times. Then the search client can be said to have Conversions of 40%. A high Conversions ratio suggests (1) the content in your knowledge base is useful and (2) your search engine is bringing up relevant results most of the time. The Conversions tab in Home combines the numbers from all your search clients and reports the average figure. Live Streaming The first section after the tiles. It has two reports. Live Search Stream Live Search Stream displays the location your search client users in real time. Like Recent Search (next), Live Search Stream also auto-refreshes itself. Recent Search Recent Search displays a list of the latest queries from your users across all your search clients. The data is constantly being pulled because the list auto-refreshes itself. Analytics Overview There are three reports in Analytics Overview. Search Performance Overview This graph summarizes a month's data of All Searches Same as Total Searches., All Searches with Results Same as With Results., and All Searches with Clicks. The last report is the sum of all search sessions in which users clicked at least one result. Case Deflection The widget monitors two metrics: Global Search Page. Case deflection equals Conversions. A conversion occurs when a user searches, find results, and click on at least one result in a session. The metric is available on all search clients. Case Form. Available only on platforms that support a case creation page. A case creation page is a dedicated web page where users can log tickets. Case Form deflection metric is zero on all platforms where a case creation page is not set up. If a case creation page is set up and Stage 2 Case Deflection is activated, then Case Form shows what percent of users started logging a case and then changed their mind after viewing a help article on the case deflection page. The insights obtained in both metrics are search client specific. You can use the dropdown to view insights for any of your search clients. In case your job requires you to look after a search client more often than others, you can set the search client as default. Simply select your search client from the dropdown and click . Case Deflection will always display for the pinned search client unless you unpin it. Most Searched Keywords Top Searched Keywords generates a word cloud of the most frequently-searched keywords. The keywords are extracted from search queries and one query might have more than one keyword. For instance, the search query Install SearchUnify in Salesforce has three keywords install, searchunify, and salesforce. Recommendations There are two reports in Recommendations. Actionable Insights Actionable Insights reads the reports in Home and Search Analytics, identifies information that needs your immediate attention, and translates that information into plain English. Because each search client caters to a different set of audience—the one on your corporate website to customers and the one in your Service Console to support agents—consequently, the insights obtained are search client specific. You can use the dropdown to view insights for any of your search clients. In case your job requires you to stay on top of a search client, you can set it as default. Simply select your search client from the dropdown and click . Actionable Insights will always display for the pinned search client unless you unpin it. Next Best Action Next Best Action processes the data in Actionable Insights and the reports in Search Analytics to suggest the next course of action. The suggestions are shown next to the Actionable Insights window and generated by a customer success engine. SearchUnify Help Assistant SearchUnify Help assistant enhances the help support experience for the Admin. When enabled (contact SearchUnify team), the Help option from the Menu Bar is swapped with an intent-driven virtual agent. To access the agent, click the SearchUnify Help banner. When fired up, it shows up help related to the screen an SU Admin is on. If the Admin is editing Content Sources, then the help suggestions will be around content sources.

You can set up content fields where the suggestions come from. Alternatively, it's possible to create a custom dictionary of suggestions. Finally, a new feature, Hide Suggestions, allows you to turn off suggestions on a select list of keywords. Fig. 1 The feature is advanced in the sense that it works with all supported languages—including Mandarin, Russian, and French—and can be trained in-house terminology. An example of in-house terminology at work is in Fig. 1, where Did You Mean suggests searchunify instead of search and unify. It's possible expand the default Did You Mean dictionary by adding such product names, technical terminology, and other terms in bulk or one at a time. Advantages Jargon Recognition. In-house terminology, customer and employee names are recognized and never ""corrected"". Instead of asking a search if he meant ""Osama Dazai"" when he was actually looking for Japanese author ""Osamu Dazai"", Did You Mean recognizes the name as long as they are stored in Custom Dictionary. Guaranteed Results. Each suggestion has at least one matching document if a search client is connected to all the content sources from which the suggestions are extracted. It never happens that a user clicks on a suggestion and is greeted with a ""No Results Found"" message. Synonym Recognition: Keywords—including jargon, abbreviations, and initialisms—set as synonyms are never tinkered with. If you set up ""enzootic cycle"" and ""EnC"" as synonyms then a search for ""EnC"" will find results for ""enzootic cycle"" and Did You Mean will not make any attempt to correct ""EnC."" Dictionary Recognition. There are a some minor differences between the English and American orthography. Whereas an American will ""plow"" in four letters an Englishman will go on for another two characters to ""plough"". The ""jailer"" in America is nothing like the ""gaoler"" in England. SearchUnify recognizes these differences is not triggered by any of those queries. Ite has been designed to recognize multiple correct variants of a query. Adding Data to Did You Mean Go to NLP Manager and then open Did You Mean . In Bulk Though this method, you can submit data for auto-correction. In the example, Product Documentation Category data is set up for auto-correction. When this happens, auto-correct springs to action each time a category name is misspelled in search.

But sometimes, an admin might want to turn it off for certain keywords. Those keywords could be product names that aren't part of the standard language. Consider the case of Copy-Cat Organization who has come up with a brand new insect repellant, ""Salesforc"". After winning the battle to get it trademarked, they are now confronted with another challenge. Every time a customer looks up ""salesforc"", Did You Mean suggests ""Salesforce.""

For one, each keyword in a query matters. install searchunify in a salesforce org brings different results from install searchunify salesforce org. Through Stopwords, the default search behavior can be changed so that the presence or absence of grammatical particle, keyword or phrase has no impact on results; and your customers or employees have a consistent search experience for similar queries. It is a common practice to exclude common grammatical particles . You can expand the list with your organization-specific keywords. For instance, using ""secretProductName"" as a stopword adds a layer of security on top of search client access control. Insert Stopwords Go to NLP Manager and open Manage Stopwords.

SearchUnify will use the feature, on top of email, to broadcast information. Content Sources The last release of 2019 extends support for three new content sources, accelerates loading, adds an indexing updation icon, and improves indexing for Salesforce. What's New? Docebo For someone who has gotten used to searching their way to answers, navigation can seem like a chore. Take Docebo. For an organization that uses Docebo to onboard interns and upskill employees, logging into the platform multiple times a day to monitor student progress isn't easy. We came up with a solution. Docebo is now supported out-of-the-box. So the next time you want to see Jane's enrolled courses, you can use your search client. Learn more: How to Use Docebo As a Content Source? Slack Wouldn't it be great if you could search company chats, channels, and new groups? Your wish has come true. Now you can crawl Slack with a few clicks. It has become an official SearchUnify content source. As for retrieval, the data can be viewed from a search client installed in Slack or any of the 10-plus platforms—including Salesforce, Lithium, Zendesk, and Microsoft Dynamics—we support. Learn more: How to Use Slack As a Content Source? Vimeo For business owners obsessed with video quality, Vimeo is often the platform of choice. Now, the same owners have a new reason to continue using Vimeo: SearchUnify support. You can now connect your Vimeo channel to SearchUnify. It takes a few clicks and your Vimeo videos become searchable. Learn more: How to Use Vimeo As a Content Source? Enhancements Crawl Status Alerts from Icon and Email The progress icon changes color when the indexing of a content source is complete. In case you have subscribed to crawl alerts, you will receive an email notification as well. Learn more: Turn on Content Source Indexing Notifications Faster Loading Despite three new content sources, loading the content source screen has gotten quicker. It is not just our perception. We measured it. Loading is 40% faster now. A new modular structure is responsible for the increase in speed. Instead of downloading and keeping each content source in your browser's memory, the new structure requests only the content sources and data you need. À la Carte Salesforce Object Crawls The data stored in a Salesforce org can be enormous. Crawling the entire org for an update in one object is not always an efficient use of computing resources. Not to mention that it's time-consuming. We solved both challenges with our new single object crawling feature. The next time you have to synchronize just one or two Salesforce objects across your search clients, open Salesforce edit settings in Manage Content Sources, navigate to the Rules tab and click against the object to index new data. Learn more: How to Crawl Just One Object in Salesforce? Salesforce Feed Comment Search SearchUnify now supports the feed comment object. It means that any Salesforce data stored in feed comment can be searched. Enter a keyword to fetch the message, update, case, or image you are looking for. Search Clients Eye candy templates, a Slack search client, and new search results management features make this release special. What's New? Search Client in Slack Bot Find more than just files, channels, and messages on Slack. A new bot for Slack allows you to search across your data repositories from inside Slack is part of Mamba '20. Learn more: Install a Search Client in Slack Support for Multiple Service Console Search Clients per Salesforce Org This is a feature for large enterprises using multiple Salesforce Consoles. They can now set up a unique search client in each console. It personalizes user experience while improving access control. Access Control for Salesforce and Docebo Talking of access control brings us to this exciting new feature: Permission overriding. SearchUnify respects the access control settings defined in your Salesforce org or Docebo instance. A user who cannot access a Salesforce report in your org, then he or she will not be able to find it through search. This is the default setting. But now you can override that. In the Content Sources tab in Search Client are new toggle buttons. Toggling any one to the right overrides default access control settings for a content source; making your data accessible to all users. At the time of Mamba '20's release, the feature works only on Salesforce and Docebo. Learn more: Permissions Override More Templates and a New UI Efficiency goes hand-in-hand with aesthetics in SearchUnify. A bunch of new templates offers admins more choice, especially those who are reluctant to edit HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can now move facets to the right of search results, to the left, or above them with the click of a button. To make a selection, navigate to Search Clients and open the Templates tab. The UI of the Salesforce Console search client has also underwent an update. Learn more: Change Template Enhancements Facet Management Facets help users narrow down search results and they are more useful when similar facets are placed together. Right next to Change Filter Preferences is a new icon. Click it to view all the facets detected by SearchUnify and then use the drag-and-drop functions to thematically group them. You can select the theme that most suits your business requirements. Learn more: Merge Facets Filterable and Searchable Fields (Salesforce) Users are more likely to use date as a filter than search something like ""salesforce cases on 2019-09-18."" Date is clearly an object (content field) that is filterable. But not all content fields are like date. Consider the name of an author. It can be a filter (find me all the article written by ""Ray Bradbury"") or a search term (Ray Bradbury's author bio page). It is for these category-defying fields that the notion of filterable and searchable fields has been created for search clients on the Salesforce platform. Learn more: Configure Content Sources Page Rating (Salesforce Lightning) Support for Page Rating has now been extended to Salesforce Communities. It was originally conceived as a user feedback mechanism for websites. But after Mamba '20 , admins will have an option to set it up on Salesforce and discover the most helpful discussions and posts on their brand community. Learn more: Gathering User Feedback with Page Rating Chatbots The chatbots module has been completely revamped. With a new user interface, three new adapters, and powerful analytics, it has become easier to use and a more powerful instrument in your customer service toolkit. What's New? Conversations Empowers chatbot admins to create dialogues in the form of a story. The stories lay down the basis of coupling intents with a response under one roof. Learn more: Design a Conversation Live Agent Connector for Salesforce A new connector makes it quick for users to talk with your agents on Salesforce. The connector is for users who need more information than a bot can provide. Lithium Adapter for Starting Community Discussions What happens when a user wants more than what a chatbot conversation can provide? They log into your Lithium community and start a discussion. In Mamba '20, community participation has been made easier. Users can now post questions to your Lithium community right from the chat window. It is quick and convenient. SearchUnify Adapter Replace those ""Sorry, I don't understand you!"" type messages with a feature that truly helps customers. Each time an utterance falls out of scope, a new fallback option fetches results from your content sources and presents them to users. Admins can also configure the adapter so it doubles as a search client; allowing users to search from the chatbox. Analytics Admins can view chatbot analytics data in real time. The data is divided into four tabs: User Interaction: Find the number of total users who interacted with the chatbot, as well as the users who are currently online. Intent: View the most frequently triggered intents on search clients. All Reports: Discover utterance hits for intents and the responses presented. Chat Transcript. Email chat transcripts for any session to support agents. Learn more: View Chatbot Analytics Theme Editor Six settings in the powerful new Theme Editor allow you to highly customize your chatbox. Learn more: Customize Your Bot with Theme Editor Search Analytics Uncover hidden user search patterns, discover gaps in your content strategy, and receive more accurate reports with new Search Analytics. What's New? Case Form Page Reporting Pareto's principle applies to your knowledge base as well. In most organizations it is a small number of articles that are responsible for deflecting the most cases. The challenge is to identify them. A new report gives admins an insight into the articles that successfully deflected cases, along with the keywords that were used to find them. Learn more: Conversions Enhancements Advanced Filters in Session Tracking Details A new filter, With Searches, allows admins to view only those sessions in which a search was conducted. Toggle it right to activate. All Sessions is a filter, which can be used to view sessions in which a user visited support and (1) created a case or (2) did not create a case. Details in a session tracking report can be overwhelming, but they do not have to be. All Activities lets you customize reports. You can choose to limit a report to only the data that you need. Learn more: Conversions Content Gap Analysis The Searches With No Result report carries context now. Instead of simply listing the keywords for which no documents were found, the report will provide details, such as whether any filters were in use and what search operators were employed. Based on this information, admins can select the best course of action to plug content gaps: Create new article or educate users about advanced search. Admins can view context by clicking the session count of a keyword. Learn more: Content Gap Analysis Export SearchUnify Data in Your Tableau This update is for people who love data crunching. SearchUnify now connects with Tableau through its Web Data Connector. It means that you can import your entire analytics data into Tableau for more refined analyses. Two-Stage Case Deflection Added new stage to make case deflection more understandable. Two-Stage Deflection: Mamba ‘20 introduces a new, comprehensive formula that leverages a two-stage deflection model to provide a more accurate picture of search effectiveness. Add Search Filter-Based Clicks Add Revamp Overview Screen (Tiles renamed) New Email Design Templates More Comprehensive Reports in Conversions Search click-through reports have become more comprehensive and convenient to use. SearchUnify on communities reports the number of cases logged during a session. A new formula has been devised for measuring case deflections. Clicks on search suggestions now count towards conversions. Users can go to the second, third, fourth, and other search results pages without affecting the keyword search count. Search data from console search clients Salesforce, Zendesk, and other platforms is excluded because these clients are primarily used by agents. SearchUnify on communities reports the number of cases logged during a session. Search click data from merged facets is more accurate. Search Tuning Setting up SearchUnify is a one-time affair, but search optimization requires regular tweaking. The new updates make the tweaking job easier. What's New? Custom Boosting per Search Client Don't paint with a broad brush when you can be more nuanced. Admins managing more than one search client can now set different boosting scores for each search client. It frees them from the tyranny of uniformity, makes A/B testing easier, and allows for more freedom in how users are served. Learn more: Auto Enhancements Scoring Explanations in Test Your Tuning The Test Your Tuning screen is more than just a way to view the impact of your search tweaks. Each result on the screen features information about the old rank (without any tweaks) and the new rank (after your tuning), so you can quantify the impact of your changes. Learn more: Test Your Tuning Boosting Options Turn On/Off. Search boost is no longer a one-way street. You can turn on and turn off boosting with one click. The effects are visible in real time. Clicked Boosting Base. Most consulted articles tend to rank above articles that aren't read that much. You can quantify the probability. Recency. Other factors constant, the recent documents in your content sources will be ranked higher than an old document. As an admin you can control the potency of the ""recency factor."" Learn more: Custom NLP Manager If Manage Synonyms and Manage Stopwords had a kid, what would be its name? NLP Manager! NLP Manager is more than the sum of Manage Synonyms and Manage Stopwords. It is more powerful and has four features now: Add Synonyms, Suggestion Removal, Did You Mean, and Manage Stopwords. What's New? Did You Mean? A new tab has been added next to Suggestion Removal. It is called ""Did You Mean?"" and it allows admins to configure how meaningful suggestions are displayed. The data comes from your content sources, a custom dictionary, and an analysis of user search behavior. Learn more: Providing Useful Suggestions through Did You Mean Enhancements Synonym and Abbreviation Clusters In old times, the potential synonyms or abbreviations suggested by SearchUnify were based on user search patterns. The process was slow, taking as long as three to four months. Well, that was past. A new WordNet database has been included to suggest synonyms and abbreviations from day one. The database compliments the analysis of historical user search patterns. From now on, SearchUnify will analyze user search patterns and draw on its database to recommend potential synonyms and abbreviations to admins who can make selections and feed those selections to the search engine. Learn more: Add Synonyms Security SearchUnify continues to work on making search secure. This season's update includes out-of-the-box support for access control permissions, and a two-factor authentication for admins. What's New? On-Premise SearchUnify Enterprises now have a choice between SearchUnify on Cloud and On-Premise SearchUnify. The latter has been developed for organizations who are obliged to or prefer to store their data on in-house servers instead of a cloud. Two-Factor Authentication Two-factor authentication is now turned on for admins. To log in, an admin has to provide an OTP. The OTP is shared over email. Manage Users The process of adding users has been standardized and a new scope has been introduced for admins who wear several hats. What's New? New API Scope Added Power users rejoice! A new scope, All, will help you make calls to any API. Scope-hopping is now a thing of the past. For admins concerned about access control, the specialized scopes (Search, Analytics, and Content) have been kept in place. You can still assign a user any of the old scopes if you goal is to restrict calls from that user to only one API. Learn more: Change User Scope Admin User Licenses Each SearchUnify instance comes with a fixed number of user licenses. You can stay on top of how many licenses are in use with the Admin User Licenses. It is found on the Admin Users screen in Manage Users. Enhancements Invite Users The old-school method of adding users through a registration page has been put to rest. It has been replaced with an Invite New User function, which you can access in Manage Users. The new method is easier on admins and more intuitive for users. They receive a welcome email and follow through a few verification steps. Click Invite New User and enter the new user's email to share with them a registration link. The link is secure and remains active for only 24 hours. Learn more: Add a User Recover Lost Password If you cannot sign into your instance with your SearchUnify password, you can reset your password and regain access to your instance. Prerequisites. All you need is your User ID (an email account you use to log into SearchUnify) and the Answer to the security question you set up at the time of registration. Learn more: Recover Lost Password Addons The updates in Addons are primarily targeted towards supports teams. Enhancements Agent Helper The next time you open a case page on Salesforce Console and expand the Agent Helper window, you will see—on top of a list of related cases—the agents who worked on those cases, the help articles the agents shared with the customers, and a tab mapping user journey. Learn more: Install Agent Helper in Salesforce Console KCS Helper A new UI is the most conspicuous part of KCS V2, but not the only one. Other features include: Out-of-the-box support for the article type Salesforce Knowledge Support for mapping multiple article types A button to attach an article to a case and copy its URL to the clipboard with a single click Data categories for articles Learn more: Install KCS Support Console in Salesforce Console Email and Attach to Case Your support reps save time when they can find a piece of information right inside Salesforce Console. So from day one, the SearchUnify search client has been designed to work in Salesforce Console. A new update makes the search client even more useful. Admins can now configure the search client so each right click attaches articles to case comments and emails articles to customers as well as. The feature is fast and once you are used to it, impossible to imagine the world without it. Learn more: Share Results on Salesforce Console User Experience The entire raison d'être of SearchUnify is to serve end users. This section covers the updates for them. What's New? Collapsing Descriptions Nah. It is not as bad as it sounds. In fact, it is not bad at all. The underlying idea is simple: The easier it is for your employees or customers to search, the more frequently they are going to use it. SearchUnify's new collapsible summaries make it easier to compare search results, especially if you are on a small screen. Clicking Show Less hides meta data and description so more results can fit on a mobile phone, tab, or notebook screen. That allows you to review results with minimal scrolling. SearchUnify for Chrome A great news for heavy search users. Instead of firing up a new tab each time you need a search client, you can rummage through your content sources right from your Chrome address bar. Prefix the search term with ""su"" and ""space"" and press Enter after your keyword(s). The extension does not become your default search engine, so you have the best of both worlds. The installation instructions are on the Chrome store. Learn more: Search with Chrome Extension Hide Facet Categories SearchUnify admins decide what content types (object properties) will be used as facets. However, as an end user you can hide the facets you do not frequently use. Personalize How Results Are Displayed A document on a results page has five elements: 1. Title, 2. Summary, 3. URL, 4. Metadata, and 5. Icon. Each of these elements can be hidden for more personalized search experience. This article walks you through the process. Learn more: Personalize How Results Are Displayed Rearrange Facet Categories Facets are an advanced search feature. Because they act as filters, users can check one or more of them to confine the scope of their search and find more relevant documents. Among other properties, a facet can be a tag, created date, content source, or even case status. The default order of facets is decided by SearchUnify admins, but as an end user you have an option to change that. Learn more: Rearrange Facet Categories Set a Favorite Content Source It is possible to configure your search client so it fetches documents from just one content source. In the SearchUnify lingo, it is called favoriting a content source. Learn more: Set Favorite Content Source Support for 日本語, Español, and All Languages Between Polyglots rejoice! You now have an option to change interface language and define content source languages. You can upload a file of translated labels to localize your instance in a language of your choice. The next image showcases a search client in Mandarin Chinese. Enhancements Similar Searches Similar Searches suggests potentially useful search terms on the first page of search results. The suggestions are formed after analyzing search data, which SearchUnify handles itself. All what the users see is a list of ""Similar Keywords"" or ""Others Also Searched For"". Recent Searches The search suggestions menu also contains a list of recent searches now. Users are offered search suggestions as well as a list of the keywords that they have searched.

15,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Release-Notes/Mamba-22-Release-Notes.htm,Mamba '22 Release Notes,"Mamba '22 Release Notes Mamba ‘22 brings truckloads of improvements, fixes, and new feature implementations to improve your experience as an admin and a search user. Artificial Intelligence. AI comes to the fore in SearchUnify in this release. SU admins can now harness the power of artificial intelligence to create taxonomies, annotate content, set up multimedia rich snippets on search results pages with a click, and deliver powerful personalization search experiences. Core Platform. This release brings three new crawlers (MS Teams, RSS Feeds, and Seismic), a search client (Joomla!), and a new rating mechanism to solicit feedback on content and search experiences. Applications. Major changes in the apps include: Virtual Agents gets a new analytics dashboard, Escalation Predictor Dashboard can now be imported to Salesforce orgs, and KCS extends support for Zendesk. These and all other updates have been covered in this document. You can read from the beginning till the end or use the menu on the right to jump straight to the section on a module or app. Mamba ‘22 starts rolling out to customers for sandbox deployment towards the end of December 2021, and production deployment begins at the beginning of January 2022. All updates-related queries can be directed to support@searchunify.com. Core Platform Five modules have been updated: Home, Content Sources, Search Clients, Search Analytics, and NLP Manager. Home Convert UTC to your local time zone You can now change the timestamps in your SearchUnify instance from UTC to your local time zone. The change impacts all modules, except Search Analytics, Alerts, KCS, and Escalation Predictor. They continue to use UTC. The feature is user-specific, which means that your switching locales doesn’t change the experience for other SU Admins who continue to see UTC timestamps until they switch themselves. Bookmark your favorite search client No longer does your instance require you to select a search client each time you log in to view analytics, change tuning, or edit suggestions in NLP Manager. From the Select Search Client dropdown in all these modules, you can pick a search client and pin it. After that, unless you change settings, the instance will always default to the pinned search client on Homepage, Search Analytics, Search Tuning, and NLP Manager. Status Page Find account details and incidents logs on Status Page Status Page is a dashboard for monitoring the availability of five SearchUnify services and viewing incident activity. It is out of beta and is accessible from the Menu Bar and on https://status.searchunify.com/, where you can log in with your SearchUnify credentials. The five services covered are: Admin, Analytics, Crawler, Search Client, and Search. Incidents are the tickets or issues that you have logged with the SearchUnify team. You can view solved issues in the right tab, Past Incidents, and in Current Incidents, you can check the progress on your ongoing tickets. Content Sources Out-of-the-box support for three new crawlers Mamba ‘22 extends crawling capabilities to three new platforms: MS Teams: crawler is capable of crawling and indexing data in Teams, Files, Wikis, Tasks, and Messages. Seismic Crawler: can index Microsoft Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, PDFs, and practically all the files used for building MicroApps and LiveContent. RSS Feed: crawler connects with an RSS feed and indexes title, description, link, language, and last update time for items and channels. Crawl Logs reads like a well-written story The monospace text pasted against a Bash-like background has been replaced with a sleeker window with dynamic text which updates itself as crawl progress. Error logs and success logs have been updated, so that instead of ""[ERROR] process ended with error"" you get an accurate diagnosis. Crawl private case comments on Salesforce The Case field where private case comments are stored can now be crawled by the standard SearchUnify search client package on AppExchange. You now get a choice to allow end-users to search through private comments and fetch details on a resolution. Apply taxonomy with Content Annotation In Content Annotation, you select content sources and objects where taxonomies created in NLP Manager are applied. Please check out Organize enterprise knowledge with Taxonomy to understand the use. Search implemented in Rules for 12 content sources You don’t have to scroll endlessly to find your Jira or Slack channel for crawling. A new search function has been implemented in the Rules tab of 12 content sources. Using that feature, you can look up: Channels in YouTube, Vimeo, Slack, and Jira Topics in Sharepoint and Zendesk Products in Azure Drops and ServiceNow Repositories in Github Places in Confluence Boards in Khoros Communities in Higher Logic Search Clients Install search client as a Joomla! package A new search client is now available for the open-source content management platform (CMS), Joomla! The search client can be installed like any Joomla! package. Sleeker new skin for Merge Facets Merge Facets gets a more intuitive interface. A search box in Select Filters to Merge allows you to look up facet values without endless scrolling. Once you have merged facets, you can send the merging details for review. The email contains a CSV file with Merge Facet name in the first column and Merge Facet values in the second column. Multimedia support comes to Rich Snippets Rich snippets on a search results page can now display images and videos for qualifying queries. You can click on an image to expand it and on a video to play it right on the search results page. Each click counts as a conversion. Support for text has been expanded with AI so that end-users don’t always have to prefix a query with “how to” to trigger rich snippets. The new AI analyzer interprets the query and fetches the most reasonable snippet. Club similar content tabs in Set Default Preferences Bring order to the tab-jumble by clubbing similar content sources. This feature is useful for SU admins who have linked multiple content sources to a search client. The image illustrates end-user experience. User Guides get their own tab but all documentation content sources have been clubbed into Docs Change default relationship between search terms: AND or OR Newly-introduced Relevancy tab allows you to change the relationship operator in queries consisting of two or more terms. Right now “nlp manager”, “content sources list”, and “salesforce communities search client” are interpreted as “nlp OR manager”, “content OR sources OR list”, and “salesforce OR communities OR search OR client.” After upgrading to M22, you get a choice. The default operator can be set to either AND or OR. Improve search experience with results personalization Help end-users find what they are looking for faster with personalized results. AI-powered personalization scans individual facet click patterns. If personalization is turned on, then end-users who click filter Docs over Community Discussions get more results from Docs. AI working behind the scenes automatically applies the most-suitable filter. Personalization on a search client has no impact on other search clients. SU Admins can turn on and turn off this feature through a toggle. As for end-users, they can go incognito to compare personalized and common results. Hide filters pane on three search clients Reduce clutter on the All Content tab by removing facets from the search results page. This feature has been implemented on all search clients, except for Higher Logic, Zendesk Support, SharePoint, Microsoft Dynamics, Zendesk Support Console, and SlackBot. 3X improvement in Salesforce Console search experience Linking cases, sharing articles with anchor text, and previewing search results have been streamlined in the Salesforce Console search client. You don’t have to attach shared articles on cases in Salesforce Lightning. The next time you send an article to a customer, it will automatically be linked to the case. Copy the link to an article to get the link with hypertext. It means that you can now copy https://searchunify.com/ to get SearchUnify. The anchor text is the article title. Support agents can now take a sneak-peek at KB articles right inside their SF Console search client. End-user feedback on search results relevance You can now add two feedback mechanisms right on a search results page where end-users can review search experience and content quality. You can seek feedback only for search, only for content, or for both. Each section in the feedback form is configurable, right from the display message to feedback type. Search Analytics Look up sessions by case number in Search Sessions Details You can pull out the search sessions in which end-users log tickets by case ID. The feature currently works for Salesforce Communities and offers greater opportunity to figure out the needs of end-users. In other changes, email search has been reworked, and now allows you to look up sessions by complete email address, account name, or domain name. Also, facet information is tagged along each time you download or share the Session Tracking Details report. Session Tracking Details recognizes two kinds of searches for SF Console The results that are loaded on launching your search client in Salesforce Console are now classified as Default Searches. Each instance for entering a query and pressing search is an Active Search. Filter by Search Type in Session Tracking Details allows you to pull up sessions with active, default searches, or both. Prevent repeat Searches with No Result Stay on top of your team’s actions to prevent no-result queries from repeating. Your team puts one of the seven available tags on each query: Pending, In Progress, Update Content, New Content, Add Synonyms, No Action Required, and Completed. They can tag a query with “Pending” if they have had a chance to work on it or “Completed” if they have analyzed the query and are reasonably confident that a future search for the query will return at least one result. NLP Manager Organize enterprise knowledge with Taxonomy You can now create taxonomy rules to organize enterprise data. Think of it this way. In your Salesforce Community, you have 1000 posts about, let’s say, five different products. Not all the posts are properly tagged. There are only 50 posts about your most popular product, Bonds, but you sense that there ought to be more. With Taxonomy, you can find the exact number of posts for each product. To start, create an Entity in Taxonomy and enter its values. In our example, the entity can be Product and its values the actual product names. Once the entities have been defined, you can switch Content Annotation in Content Sources and tag the posts on your community with product names. An advantage of AI-powered tagging is that it’s lightning-fast, even on large communities. Once the posts have been tagged, you can use the tag names (entity values) as filters, allowing your users to click Bonds to find all posts around that product. Search comes to Synonyms Long lists of synonyms are no longer a maintenance nightmare. A search option in Synonyms List and List of Added Synonyms and Abbreviations lets you sift through them faster with a powerful search box, which looks up both headwords and synonyms. Stopwords gets a new appearance and features A new interface makes adding and removing stopwords a pleasure and enhances overall experience. New capabilities include search and delete buttons. A separate text box at the home improves aesthetics. The terminology has also been updated. ""Edit Stop Words"" is now ""Add Stopwords"". Apps Three apps have received major updates: Virtual Agent, KCS Enabler, and Escalation Predictor. Virtual Agent Analytics dashboard for Virtual Agent Stay on top of virtual agent performance with five new reports, which tell you everything you need to know as a support manager. The reports are: Overview lists four metrics: Total Sessions, Total Conversations, Successful Conversations, and Coverage. All Conversations and Coverage Line Chart is a collection of two line charts. The first shows total conversations and the second is a ratio of Successful Conversations to Total Conversations. Intents keeps you informed about most used intents and the most triggered utterances within an intent. Chat Transcript is where you can find coverage, intent use, handover, and other data. Non-intrusive way to solicit feedback on virtual agent experience Customers usually don’t like being chased over email and telephone for feedback. Put yourself in your customers’ shoes and imagine receiving an email which reads: “Hey, you conversed with our chatbot, Molly, last Monday. How was your experience?” There is a good chance that you will never reply. Newly-introduced User Feedback increases your likelihood of getting feedback without being intrusive. Activate it and it will ask customers to either thumb up or thumb down a conversation. Based on this data, you can improve stories. Enter your definition of success in Virtual Agent Settings A framework has been introduced to help you configure your own definition of success. If user feedback matters the most to you, then you can configure Settings that only virtual agent conversations with feedback are considered successful. In the same vein, if link clicks matter ,then you can configure Settings so that the conversations with no clicks on a link are unsuccessful. Preview before you go live with virtual agent changes Mamba ‘22 makes experimentation safer. You can now preview how your new stories and webhooks edits, and entities removals are going to impact the end-user experience. After making the changes, train your bot and click Preview. During previews, you can edit responses. KCS Enabler KCS Support Console is now KCS Enabler After switching to Mamba '22, you will notice that KCS Support Console has been renamed to KCS Enabler. It doesn't merely has a new name, it has a host of new features and support for Zendesk Console. Adoption analytics introduced in KCS Dashboard Newly introduced KCS Dashboard is a central place to measure KCS adoption and obtain ideas to improve usage. It is packed with four reports. Use Overview and Contributor Analytics to measure content writing statistics. Both reports keep you on top of how many articles have been created from cases and who is creating the most articles. Look at Support Effectiveness and KCS Article Usage for content use numbers. The first tracks the contribution of KCS articles in solving cases. It stores data on solved cases that have at least one KCS article attached. The second follows the most linked KCS articles to cases. KCS Enabler configuration moved from Search Clients to Apps KCS now behaves like all other apps in that instead of being configurable from inside a search client, it can now be set up from Apps. This change does not break current configurations which will move automatically after your instance has been updated to Mamba ‘22. Supported platforms have been increased to two , namely Salesforce and Zendesk. Install up KCS Enabler in Zendesk Console Your agents in Zendesk Console can now switch to the KCS mode of content generation. KCS Enabler has been added to Zendesk Console. It is packed with all the functions and features you see in the KCS Enabler for Salesforce Console. Salesforce field dependencies and multimedia support Agents in Salesforce can now insert images and embed videos in their articles. The app supports Salesforce field dependencies natively. Escalation Predictor Synchronize Escalation Predictor dashboard in Salesforce Cases can escalate in the time you switch between your SearchUnify instance and Salesforce org. Your SearchUnify instance lists the cases that are likely to escalate and your Salesforce org has case details. To save time (and escalations), Escalation Predictor has been synchronized with Salesforce so that you can view both the case list and cases data inside your org. Export case details to Slack groups You can now pull in experts from departments all over your organization to resolve complex customer cases faster. My Channels features Share which lets you send case details to Slack groups. You can set up a Slack group for cases for type X and another for cases for type Y. When a complex ticket shows up, you can simply click Share and check a group. The job of My Channels is to collect all details concerning a case and post them in the Slack group, where experts can brainstorm a solution together. My Channels is available in the recently introduced Escalations Dashboard for Salesforce. Bug Fixes Open results in background with wheel click A new behavior for mouse clicks has been implemented. Clicking on the wheel of a mouse now opens a new tab in the background. Left-click and right-click function as before. Left-clicking opens a result in a new and right-click displays a menu. Get accurate data on internal users Search sessions in which an external user logs into a platform are now considered internal user sessions. The rationale behind the change is that once an end-user has identified themselves, all the activities in their search session ought to retroactively move to internal users’ data.

The new additions to the content source connectors are: Service Now MindTouch Dropbox Moodle SOLR Marketo** Apart from offering out of the box connectors for 27 content repositories, SearchUnify now also offers a Content Source API, which you can leverage to connect any content source of your choice—if an out-of-the-box connector is not available for it—to SearchUnify and start fetching results from. **Mamba-Marketo connector only supports Marketo activities; we’ll extend it to support LPs and other assets in the next upgrade. Search Clients Mamba empowers you to improve the user experience for the end users (your customers/prospects) as well as for the SearchUnify admin users: New Search Clients With Mamba, SearchUnify adds more platforms to its list of search clients. New platforms that it supports now include: MS Dynamics. With Mamba, we’ve extended support for MS Dynamics as well. If your service representatives are using Dynamics, you can enable them to provide better and quicker support now. Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 and WordPress. Now you can convert your site powered by Drupal 7 or 8 or WordPress into a single source of truth and further increase engagement conversion. Console Search Client 2.0 We’ve improved the user experience of support engineers using Salesforce Service Cloud and empowered them to provide better and quicker customer support. Improved UI. Mamba comes with an improved layout for Salesforce Console search results. We’ve made an optimum use of the real estate in the Console to ensure a better user experience and easier case resolution for support engineers using Salesforce Service Console. Better Search for Support Engineers. With Mamba, SearchUnify doesn’t run a default search on subject lines but asks the support agents for more information to deliver better results. Contextual Ads SearchUnify now enables you to use your help center to upsell and cross-sell your products. You can run contextual advertisements above the search results when a user searches for a query. The feature works similar to any search engine advertising platform – you choose your keywords, define the products to recommend/advertise, create your copy/images, and start advertising on your support platform. Search Operators Mamba now shows Search Tips in all search clients that help your prospects/customers with instructions on how to search better. If a user wants to run a Boolean search or negative search or exact search and so on, they will see the tips right there on every search client they visit. Responsive Template Preview Now you can easily preview, right inside the SearchUnify admin interface, how search will appear on mobile and tablet (Currently supports Lithium, Visualforce Communities, WordPress, Drupal, and ZenDesk). Nested Categories in Facets Navigation and facet categorization is even better and more structured in Mamba, especially for Salesforce KnowledgeBase content. This will help the searchers locate the articles they’re looking for using the KB content categories and sub-categories. HTML Preview Options We’ve improved the customization experience in Mamba. You can use the Designer to customize the search results page as well as preview the changes live in a parallel window. Customizable ‘No Search Results’ Page You can now customize the ‘No Results’ page by adding your own HTML to the Designer. You can use this page to display a custom message or CTA buttons to log a case or to go back to the home page Modal Layout We are committed to offering our customers as much flexibility as possible – from adding their choice of a content source to fine-tuning search results to customizing search result pages and clients. You can choose whether you want to show the search results page as a pop-up window or embed search results right inside the client. Pre-Search Filters* Now, you can help your users run more advanced and targeted search. the users canThey can select filters first and then run a search. If they want to see results from a specific content repository or a particular category, they can do so. *Pre-Search Filters are currently available only for the Lithium search client. Search Tuning We’ve taken search tuning up a notch. In Mamba, you can boost search results for multiple keywords as well as preview the tuned search results within the console. Multiple Keywords Boosting Now, You can tune your content documents for single or multiple keyboards and set different boosting factor per keyword. Search Tuning Preview We have improved manual search tuning. Now, you can preview the score and appearance of boosted search results. In the preview window, you can type a query in the search box, hit enter, and see the list of results along with their score and sequence of appearance. Analytics Analytics has always been our forte. In order to continue our strides towards delivering business intelligence, we have upped the ante. The forthcoming bullets explain how: Analytics 2.0 Mamba comes with comprehensive reports. We’ve revamped and regrouped all the reports to help you make better sense of all the data. We’ve updated the following three tabs: Overview Tab. The overview tab groups all search reports into one. You can see ‘all searches’, ‘successful searches’, ‘converted searches’, ‘searches with no clicks’, and ‘searches with no results’ at one place. Here, ‘converted searches’ are those which showed results and got clicks as well, while ‘successful searches’ are those where results received clicks and no case was created after them. Conversions Tab. Under this tab, you can view further detailed reports related to converted searches – ‘users with converted searches’, ‘users without converted searches’, ‘session analytics’, ‘case deflection, and so on. Content Gap Analysis Tab. This tab shows all the reports that help you understand the performance of your content, highlightig content engagement and content gaps. It now also includes a new report ‘average time spent on a document’. Reports We’ve improved the existing reports as well as added new ones to help you make better sense of the user search behavior and your content’s performance. Average Page View Time Reports One important yardstick to measure content engagement and effectiveness is how much time a user spent on a particular page after clicking it. The analytics dashboards now include an average page view time report to help you measure that metric. Dashboard The dashboard in SearchUnify now is a lot more informative and customizable. You can create and customize your own dashboard selecting from more than 20 reports. You can further filter reports by date range and search client type. With the increased number of reports, we’ve saved you from all that scrolling to find a particular report. We’ve integrated an interactive search inside the admin panel from where you can search for and find the report you want to access. By the way, the admin panel search can be used to access not only a report but any feature within SearchUnify. Named Tracking SearchUnify tracks every logged-in user and reports their search behavior and history. To ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR, it encrypts the user ID and shows an anonymized unique number instead. However, now you can choose to see the actual user email ID by installing the email ID tracker. Filters To help you sort your reports, SearchUnify Analytics 2.0comes with report-level filters. Following are the three filters you can use: Filter by Internal And External Users. To analyze how many employees and customers/prospects are using search and how Filter by Client Name. To view your reports for one particular search client Filter by Date Range. To check data for any particular time-span AI & Machine Learning ML is the highlight of the Mamba release. We’ve introduced an AI-powered chatbot and added a number of new features to improve the user as well as admin experience. Chatbots With Mamba, we’re introducing Chatbots to assist your users guided conversations to find and reach the right answers to their queries. These AI-powered bots are totally customizable and configurable according to your unique business requirements. They engage users, understand their intent, and respond to them with the information they’re seeking. Machine Learning makes the chatbots trainable and helps them build their own intent dictionary, responses, conversation stories, with which they start understanding the user intent and interacting with them the way you train them to. Intent Dictionary. You can define the user intents in the Intent Dictionary by segmenting various phrases into intents, which then the bot starts identifying and building on. Intent Trainer. All the phrases you input that later are categorized into intents are added here under this tab. Response Designer. You define all your responses to the queries you used in the Intent Trainer here. Conversation Designer. Along with training the bot on understanding the user intent, you can also define basic conversation stories that the bot will improvise on and interact with the users. You can also train the bot on using a particular tone that matches your branding and positioning. Synonym Factory 2.0 The admin no longer has to manually build a synonyms’ list by adding new words to it. With the power of machine learning, Mamba analyzes user queries and auto-generates synonyms. The admin can manage synonyms by checking the synonyms’ list and accepting the relevant words and rejecting the unrelated/irrelevant ones and train the SearchUnify Synonym Factory to build its own list of synonyms. Agent Helper In support channels and clients (e.g. Service Console, ServiceNow etc.) SearchUnify now displays a first response helper window. SearchUnify analyzes the content of support agents’ previous responses to queries and, using machine learning, shows the most relevant answer to help support executives write the first response to the query. Semantic Knowledge Graph SearchUnify now delivers not only the exact information that a user is looking for but also the most relevant and useful knowledge related to the query, all at one place, making your search client the single source of truth for its users. For example, if a user searches for “how to change preferences in product X” SU will display a “how to” video about editing the settings of product X, published on YouTube and also show links to the product X documentation, support helpline number, latest updates, information about the latest release, and maybe, known bugs if you choose to show them. Security & Controls We’ve put a lot of emphasis on data security with Mamba. Along with the option to host your indexes on premises, we’ve added various access controls to make SearchUnify a robust and more secure solution. On-Premises To ensure that your data is secure and remains only with your organization, Mamba offers you to host your SearchUnify index on premises. The option is available as a free add-on, which you can simply install from the ‘Add-ons’ tab within your SU admin interface. Access Control Define who can and who can not access the admin panel by whitelisting IP addresses. You can also define what level of access a user within a particular network has by restricting the IP address. Configurable Timeout Sessions When analyzing user behavior, ignorance is not bliss. If a user logs in to a search client, opens another tab or window, and returns to the search client after a couple of hours, your analysis should not consider it one session. Mamba, therefore, allows you to configure and set the session timeout value on your own. APIs In addition to the Analytics API, Mamba offers two new APIs. Content API You can leverage this API to add a content repository of your choice, for which an out-of-the-box connector is not available yet, to your list of content repositories. Search API Use this API to show SearchUnify search on any client of your choice and customize search interface the way you want it. Add-ons We’ve introduced five free add-ons with Mamba. Currently, Agent Helper, Chatbot, Case Deflection, Email Tracking, and On-Premises features come as add-ons. You can simply install them with one click from the Add-ons tab within the console. Apart from all these upgrades and features, Mamba also comes with an in-product search embedded within the admin panel to complement and improve the console navigation. You can use this search to access any feature or report directly – without having to navigate through multiple tabs. For example, you can manage synonyms either by clicking on the ‘manage synonyms’ tab on the left-side menu or directly by typing ‘synonyms’ in the search bar and hitting enter."

18,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Developer-Guides/curl.htm,OAuth 2.0 Authentication (curl),"Get Access and Refresh Token Using curl The quickest way to get an access token and a refresh token is to launch your terminal and run the following command: Copy Obtain Access and Refresh Tokens curl -i -X POST 'https://{{hostname}}/oauth/token' \ -H ""authorization: Basic {{base64([clientId]:[clientSecret])}}"" \ -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \ -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \ -d 'grant_type=password&username={{USERNAME}}&password={{PASS}}' Prerequisite In order to run the command, among other parameters, you need a client secret and client ID, both of which can be obtained by creating an app inside your SearchUnify instance. Check out Get Client ID and Client Secret with an API App for instructions. Parameters There are three parameters in the endpoint URL. Instance URL ({{hostname}}). For instance, yourcompany.searchunify.com. Your client ID and client secret ({{base64([clientID]:[clientSecret]}}). Concatenate the ID and secret, and encode the resulting string using Base64. SearchUnify log-in credentials (grant_type=password&username={{USERNAME}}). Enter the email and password used to log into your SearchUnify instance. Generate Access Tokens Repeatedly Once you have both refresh and access tokens, a more efficient way to generate access tokens repeatedly is to use the call described in Obtain an Access Token from a Refresh Token."

Because they act as filters, users can check one or more of them to confine the scope of their search and find more relevant documents. Among other properties, a facet can be a tag, created date, content source, or even case status. The default order of facets is decided by SearchUnify admins, but as an end user you have an option to change that. Rearranging Facet Categories Click on a search results page. Select when you are presented with two options. Rearrange facet categories by dragging one at a time. You can pull a facet category down or push it up. Click Apply Settings to save the new order."
20,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/End-User-Personalization/Use-Advanced-Search-M22.htm,Use-Advanced-Search,"Use Advanced Search Refine your searches with search operators and the advanced search filter to find what you are looking for in less time. SearchUnify provides three Boolean operators, an exact match capability, and two wildcards—for terms and characters respectively. To use any of any operator, prefix your search query with an octothorpe (#) and space. Example Search Query # salesforce NOT lithium finds all documents that have the keyword salesforce but don't have the keyword lithium. NOTE. An operator works on the word following it. To use an operator on a phrase, either enclose the phrase in double quotes or use parenthesis. Examples: # community NOT ""china programmers"": Find documents with the term community, but without the phrase ""china programmers"". # community NOT china programmers: Find documents with the terms community and programmers but not china # community NOT (china AND programmers): Find documents with the terms community, but neither china nor programmers. Search Operators AND or && Returns documents containing the terms or phrases on the left and right of AND. The operator is interchangeable with &&. Although AND is used in the examples, you can swap it with && without impacting search. Examples: # content AND source AND DYNAMICS (Find documents that have all three keywords in them: content, source, and dynamics, irrespective of the order. Case has no impact on search. DYNAMICS, dynamics, Dynamics, and dYNaMiCs are all processed identically.) # ""content source"" AND dynamics (Find documents that have the phrase content source and the keyword dynamics.) A second way to run a phrase search is to use parenthesis. # (content source) AND dynamics finds all the documents that have the phrase content source and the keyword dynamics. # content source AND dynamics (Find documents that have the keyword source and the keyword dynamics.) # content source AND dynamics client (Find documents that have two keywords. The first is either content or source and the second is either dynamics or client.) OR or || Finds documents containing either of the terms or phrases around OR. The operator is interchangeable with ||. Although OR is used in the examples, you can swap it with || without impacting search. # searchunify OR su OR SFY (Find documents that at least one of these three keywords: searchunify, su, and SFY.) OR can be clubbed with ANDfor complex queries, such as # blog AND (searchunify OR su) returns documents which have blog and either searchunify or su. SearchUnify processes uppercase and lowercase words in the same manner, so there is no difference between SFY, sfy, and SFy. # ""content source"" OR dynamics (Find documents that have the phrase content source or the keyword dynamics or both.) A second way to run a phrase search is to use parenthesis. # (content source) OR dynamics finds all the documents that have either the phrase content source or the keyword dynamics or both. # content source OR dynamics (Find documents that have either a keyword from content and source or the keyword dynamics.) # content source AND dynamics client (Find documents that either of two keywords. The first is either content or source and the second is either dynamics or client.) NOT or - or ! Excludes documents that contain the term or phrase followed by NOT. The operator is interchangeable with - and !. Although NOT is used in the examples, you can swap it with - or !without impacting search. # Release NOT Mamba or #Release NOT Mamba finds documents that have the keyword Release but not the keyword Mamba. A space after # and case has no impact on the search operator. # Salesforce Service NOT Console finds documents that have either Salesforce and Service but not Console. However, # Console NOT (Salesforce Service) finds documents but not Service Services. Keywords between double quotes and parenthesis are considered as exact phrases. # Salesforce NOT Services NOT Console finds documents that Salesforce but neither of Services and Console. "" "" Double quotes are used to look up phrases as they are. ""install searchunify"" finds documents that have the phrase install searchunify in that specific order. A document with only the phrase searchunify install is not returned. ? and * The question mark is a placeholder for a character and the asterisk for a phrase. # a?l finds documents with three letter words whose first letter is A and the last letter is L. The second letter can be any letter or number. Therefore, each of the following keywords match all, awl, and AOL. # search* finds documents with keywords that have search in them. When # search* is run, documents with the keywords, such as searches, searching, and searched, are returned. + Limits the search to documents that contain the term or phrase following +. # mamba +20 (Find documents that necessarily have the keyword ""20"", along with ""mamba"".) Advanced Search Form The most frequently used operators have been added to Advanced Search. Run a search. Use the search drop down to refine your query. Three options are available: With the Exact Phrase. The query will be searched as it is. A search for ""recognise"" will not find the documents with the spelling ""recognize."" This option doesn't affect queries in language such as Chinese and English where words don't decline that much, but in languages such as Russian and Korean, the results can be significantly different. With One or More Words. All the documents containing even one word from the multiword query will be returned. ""fast food"" will return documents containing the terms ""fast"", ""food"", and ""fast food."" Without the Words. The documents containing the query will be excluded. This is equivalent to adding a hyphen in front of a query in the search box. # fast -food find all documents with a mention of ""fast"" but without ""food."" Advanced filters in use are displayed on a search results page as well. Other Features Here are more features available on a search results page. Open Results in New Tab Results open in a new tab when the left mouse button is pressed and released. To open a result in a new background tab, press the mouse wheel. Right clicking on a result shows the browser menu. Results Per Page View up to 25 results right on the first search page, up from the default 10. Scroll down to find Results Per Page and select from 10, 15, 20, or 25. The settings will be saved in session history. It means that you will see the preferred number of results during the entire session. To return to the default number, start a new session. The setting is available on all search clients and works on all devices. You have already seen Results Per Page on desktops. The next images show how Results Per Page looks like on mobile devices and in Salesforce Console. Facet Search Facets are a great way to narrow the scope of your search. If you cannot find a facet value immediately, use the . It's especially useful if the platform you are exploring is large. Run a search. Click . Find your facet value and check it. Search Terminology Term: A string delimited by space characters. Phrase: An array of terms.

21,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/FAQs/Data-Security.htm,Data Security FAQ,"Data Security FAQs Is SearchUnify a single-tenant or a multi-tenant solution? SearchUnify is a single-tenant solution. Each customer has their own independent instance of SearchUnify, which secures their index. Does SearchUnify store any data in middleware? SearchUnify stores encrypted access/refresh tokens for content sources (Lithium, Salesforce, Jive etc.). These credentials are stored to synchronize the content in the SearchUnify index. How does SearchUnify ensure that the content sources’ authentication information is secure? All the authentication access tokens/refresh tokens stored in the middleware are encrypted using AES-256 encryption algorithm. Which content objects will be accessed by SearchUnify? It depends upon what content needs to be made searchable via SearchUnify. For example, in a Lithium community, SearchUnify supports searching ideas, discussions, blogs etc. So, these content pieces will be stored in the search index. Which API is used to connect with the content sources? SearchUnify uses the standard platform REST APIs on SSL for all the content sources. For websites, Apache-based crawlers are used to crawl the websites and index the content. Does SearchUnify upgrade automatically with SAAS based content source upgrade releases? SearchUnify automatically updates its crawlers whenever there is a release upgrade of any of the SaaS-based content source. Do SearchUnify results respect the access level for content? Only those content items which a user has access to, show up in search results. For example, in the case of a Jive community, a user can see only that content in search results which belongs to the groups that he/she has access to.

22,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Apps/KCS-Enabler-Salesforce-Dashboard.htm,Monitor Adoption in Salesforce with KCS Dashboard,"Monitor KCS Adoption in Salesforce with Dashboard Dashboard gives you valuable insights into how well your agents are taking to the knowledge-first approach. You can monitor KCS adoption with the reports in Dashboard, which update every 30 minutes. Information on knowledge generation can be found in Overview.Through KCS Contributor Analytics, you can recognize star performers. This report has everything you'll need; the number of articles created, numbers on agent productivity, and the impact on articles on case resolution. To measure content performance and quantify KCS success, consult Support Effectiveness, KCS Article Usage Analytics and Low Impact KB Articles. The following filters are common to all the reports: Service Desk Management Tool. Use this filter to select the platform where KCS Support Console has been configured. The configuration details are on KCS Enabler Configuration for Salesforce Service Console. Date Range. Use this filter to generate reports for a specific day, week, month, or a period up to six months long. Overview It gives the total number of KCS articles created on the selected Service Desk Management Tool over a period specified in Date Range. The report is a doughnut chart. The share of drafts and published articles is in the ring and the sum of drafts and published articles is in the center. Article deletion has no impact on draft and publish count. If a team of support agents drafts and publishes 100 articles in a given period, only to discard 20 in the same period, then at the end of the period, the count in Overview remains 100, instead of being 80. That's because Overview monitors article creation, not deletion. Data in Overview can be downloaded as a CSV, which consists of five columns: Article ID, Article Title, Created Date, Status, and Case Number. To initiate a download, click . Alternatively, click to share the CSV file with one or more users over email. Support Effectiveness Support Effectiveness is a stacked area graph that keeps you on top of two crucial metrics; the total number of cases closed and the contribution of KCS-generated content in closing those cases. In the following chart, out of 200 closed cases 80 have been resolved wholly or in part using KCS-generated content. Therefore, support effectiveness is . Closed cases are coded in light blue and cases closed with KCS-generated content are in dark blue. The closed cases are along the y-axis and date stamps are along the x-axis. On hovering the cursor over the boundary of light blue or dark blue region, a small dialog with two metrics, Closed Cases with KCS Articles Linked and Total Closed Cases, opens. Together, they combine to give you Link Rate. A high Link Rate suggests that KCS-generated content is a big role in resolving cases. Data in Support Effectiveness can be downloaded as a CSV which consists of six columns: Case Number, Case Subject, Case Closed Date, Article Linked (ID), Article Linked (Title), and Link Date. To initiate a download, click . Alternatively, click to share the CSV file with one or more users over email. After emailing, ask the recipients to check for a email with the title ""Subject: SearchUnify KCS Support Effectiveness."" KCS Contributor Analytics While the biggest advantage of adopting KCS is obvious—solve it once, use it often—finding a way to convince a team to adopt KCS is not. One of the strategies offered by the Consortium for Service Innovation is to start in ""waves and phases."" In an organization of 250 knowledge workers, 30-50 knowledge workers can adopt KCS first. Others can join later. KCS Contributor Analytics keeps you on top of adoption statistics. Through this report, you can find the knowledge workers who create the most articles and the impact of their work on case resolution. The email of the knowledge worker who drafts one or more articles is in the first column, Author/Agent. The column is searchable, so you can pull data for a knowledge worker just by looking them up. Author/Agent lists two kinds of knowledge workers: Who have written at least one article Whose at least one article has been linked to a case during the selected Date Range To find the articles created by a knowledge worker, consult the second column. A dialog opens when you click a row in Articles Created. In the dialog are the created articles from a knowledge worker. The salesforce IDs and titles are in the first and second columns, Article ID and Article Title. Through the search box, you can pull up any article if you know its ID or Title. The dialog also contains a third column, Created Date, which tells the creation day of an article. In the fourth and last column, Linked to Cases, is the list of cases the article has been attached to. When an article has been attached to more than one cases, then each case is listed in a new row. The third column, Agent Productivity, shows the contribution of a knowledge worker in the whole. If your team shared 500 articles in November of which 20 have been written by an agent named Jane, then her contribution is . Last Created tells you the last time a knowledge worker created or updated an article. Cases Influenced is the rightmost column in KCS Contributor Analysis, and arguably the one with the most impact on your business. Instead of monitoring article volume, as Articles Created does, it monitors content usefulness. In the next image, 60% in the first row means that navtej.ahuja@grazitti.com's articles have been linked to 24 different cases in the period specified in Date Range. To find the cases, click the number. The dialog that opens lists the cases with the ID (Case Number) and title (Case Subject). The title of the created article is also in the dialog (Article Title), along with the person who linked the article to the case (Associated By) and the time of linking (Link Date). You can look up a case or an article through the search box. Data in the first four columns is searchable. Link Date allows SU Admins to sort the table. The last column in the dialog is Associated Via, which, depending upon how an article is linked with a case, can take one of the four values: Email, Attached to Case, Case Comment, and Copy to Clipboard. Data in KCS Contribution Analysis can be downloaded as a CSV file. To initiate a download, click . Alternatively, click to share the CSV file with one or more users over email. After emailing, ask the recipients to check for a email with the title ""Subject: SearchUnify KCS Contributor Analytics."" KCS Articles Usage Analytics KCS Articles Usage Analytics monitors metrics that can be used to quantify the impact of KCS on your support team’s efficiency. The impact, measured in terms of article shares, can be converted into hours of effort and dollars saved. Here’s a hypothetical scenario. Assume that an agent spends an hour to solve a ticket which reoccurs 20 times in a year. That means, 20 hours of work and pay. The alternative is to document the solution through KCS Enabler and share link to the published article in response to each customer ticket. Sharing links is faster than typing a solution in an email. Even if the documentation takes 10 hours, you will have more than recovered your investment in the course of a year. Your savings add up when multiple agents and hundreds of articles are involved. Going over the report at regular intervals, you can also get a handle on who among your agents is most active in creating the most shared articles. The report is sorted by article IDs which are to be found in the first column, Article ID (#). The octothorpe represents the total number of articles. In the next figure, you can see that the number of articles published. The article ID is 000001045. Article Title serves two functions: A quick survey of this column provides a reader a gut feeling about the kind of articles being created. A search function helps a reader quickly pull up an article by its title. Article Origin is a Salesforce Case ID. It captures the case for which the article is created. An agent can share an article on several cases. In the image, you can spot the case IDs for which articles have been created. In the Author/Agent field are captured the email addresses of the support agents who draft the articles. In the next image, both the articles by vipul.kashyap@grazitti.com. Created Date displays the date and time of creation of the article. If measuring productivity is your goal then Total Shares is the column you should keep an eye on. It displays the share count of each article. The number field in each row is clickable and can be utilized to further find out: What cases the article was attached to (Case Title) Whether the article emailed (Shared via Email), posted as a comment on a case page (Shared via Case Comment), attached to a case (Attached to Case). The fourth column, Copied to Clipboard, captures the events when a link to an article is copied, which happens when any of the three sharing options is exercised: email, case comment, or case attachment. It’s sufficient to select an option, the actual sharing doesn’t necessarily have to occur. Low Impact KB Articles Discover articles having zero to low impact on case solving with Low Impact KB Articles. The impact is measured in terms of share count. An article that’s never been shared or shared only one, two, or three times, may require some action. This report helps you identify those low-performing articles and take appropriate action. The sole section in Low Impact KB Articles is Least Used Articles. You can filter the list using: Max Share Count. One million is a low share count for a popular Hollywood track and one hundred is a high share count for a scientific article exploring the relationship between the theory of topological spaces and number theory. Max Share Count lets you set a popularity parameter that’s valid for your organization. If Max Share Count is set to 4, then all articles shared four or fewer times are considered low impact. You see only the low impact articles when this filter is applied. Last Modified Date is the second filter. You can use it to find articles updated in today, yesterday, last 7 days, this month, last month, or during a custom range. Except for the serial number (#), the report includes six different columns: Articles ID. The Article ID number. Users can also use the search functionality to search an article by its ID. Article Title. The title of the article associated with respective Article IDs. Users can use the search functionality to search an article using its title. Created By. Name of the author who created the article. Created Date. Date when the article was created. Last Modified. Date on which the article was last updated. Shares. Number of times the article has been shared. While you click on a number in the Shares column, a pop-up appears on the screen. This pop-up shows the list of cases on which that article has been shared. The screen includes three columns: Case Number, Case Subject, and Link Date."

31,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Apps/Escalation-Predictor-App.htm,Set up Escalation Predictor to Preempt Tickets,"Set up Escalation Predictor to Preempt Tickets Support agents usually develop a gut feeling for cases that are quick to solve and cases that carry with them a risk of escalation. Such agents are worth their weight in gold. If you are a support manager and find such an agent, hire them right away. But if you cannot find such an agent, try Escalation Predictor. Like an old hand, Escalation Predictor forewarns when a case is about to go south so you can take appropriate action to thwart an escalation. PREREQUISITES Escalation Predictor works only on cases which have the following fields indexed: Case Number, Created Date, Closed Date, Last Modified Date, Escalation Field, Subject, and Status, Priority or another categorical field. Before connecting your case management system with Escalation Predictor, ensure that the system has at least one escalated case. Installation Click Marketplace from main navigation, and then Install New Marketplace Addon. Install Escalation Predictor. Input Data Escalation Prediction needs to access cases before it can start analyzing them. In this section, you will learn to connect the app with a case management system. Go to Marketplace and open Escalation Predictor. Then click Connect with a Content Source. Escalation Predictor analyzes the historical cases in your system in order to predict escalations. Select a content source. NOTE As of November, 2020, only Salesforce supported. To establish a correlation between cases and escalations, SearchUnify uses the IsEscalated case field or a custom field set up by Salesforce admins. Select that field and set its value to True for IsEscalated or a value that represents an escalation in your custom field. Escalation Predictor uses an advanced model which trains on cases' data. The more the data, the more accurate the model. With Start Date, you decide how much data to keep. Pick a date and click Next. Only the tickets logged after Start Date are analyzed. Transform Data Escalation Predictor trains on cases to find those factors that lead to escalations. Depending on your case management system, the factors can easily run into dozens. The factors frequently include a case's title, a product's category, and the purchase amount. All of these factors (or case fields) are put into one of the three available categories in the app: Textual (used for sentimental analysis), Categorical, and Numerical. Drag all the text fields, such as case titles, case description, and numbers into Textual. The Categorical field is for fields like priority, product group, and category. Use the Numerical field for storing number of comments exchanged, purchase amount, and other fields with numbers. NOTE. Case number is always a Textual field and both Closed Date and Created Date are always Categorical fields. The data after connecting Salesforce with Escalation Predictor. Feature Classification NOTE. The Feature Classification tab appears only when you click Start Classification in Input Data. Based on the cases data in Textual, Categorical and Numerical, Feature Classification generates visual reports. Review them to spot patterns. For instance, for an organization which prioritizes A, B, C, D and E; if D is the largest then the cases with priority D are more likely to escalate. Also, the keyword cloud based on an analysis of case messages help you identify the triggers which suggest an imminent escalation. The analysis run on cases today might or might not be relevant six months down the line. It's recommended to click Refresh, when case volume increases significantly. For instance, after inputting data of 100,000 cases, you might want to run Refresh when the number of cases increases to 110,000 or 120,000. Scroll down to view them all. Scoring Data In Scoring Data, the metrics to be used in forecasting are picked. A rule of the thumb is to check the metrics with high correlation and uncheck the ones with low correlation and then click Retrain Model. Example: In the next image the most accurate predictor of escalation is Days to Respond, which stands at 21%. As the Days to Respond number goes up, so does the probability of an escalation. It's better to keep it checked. However, case fields that have little correlation with escalations can be removed. In the next image, Solutions Area can be unchecked."

Virtual Agents rely on SearchUnify's proprietary AI and NLP technologies. AI detects patterns in conversations and suggests new intents to admins and the job of NLP is to deconstruct user utterances and trigger the most relevant response during a conversation. Both technologies are smart to begin with, but their performance becomes more impressive when they are fed search data, which comes from the connected search client connected. Regular Behavior. Search client data gives your virtual agent its identity. If the virtual agent is connected with a search client installed on a physics community it will sound nerdy. The one getting its search data from a ticket logging platform may come across as fussy. Define Language. But the most visible impact is the choice of the tongue. Your virtual agent can greet users with a Привет! (Hello!), ask them Qu'est-ce que c'est que voulez-vous? (What is it that you want?) and bid 再见 (goodbyle) — all depending upon the search client language. If the search results are in French, your chatbot will become a Francophone, and if the search client language is set to Chinese, then the virtual agent can assist users from China, Singapore, Taiwan, and many other places where Chinese is spoken.

They can activate typeahead, turn on search recommendations, and even display a knowledge graph. All the features on are explained next. Enter Platform Name The very first setting. It allows admins to edit the existing name of their search client. Descriptive names are a great aid when you are responsible for managing several clients. Enter Base URL The login page of your SearchUnify instance is the base URL of your search client. Its role is to maintain communication between the platform where the search client is installed and the content sources managed with the instance. No. of Autocomplete Results Help users find what they want with a powerful implementation of typeahead. Select from the drop down the number of suggestions that to be displayed. Pre-Selection of Facets Pre-selection of facets auto-applies facets during searches. The facets are selected based on admin preferences, such as session identifier, and end-user behavior, such as past facet selections. Admins can define the minimum threshold for the occurrence or you can enable 'Auto Learning' feature. Enabling this feature helps show end users search page results based on their past facet selection behavior. Admins are at liberty to manage the filters for auto-learning and if they want to enable it or not. Manual facet selections would work anyways if you don't want to enable auto-learning. Special Characters Search When used with an # in queries such as # search + client, + acts an advanced search operator. The complete list of such operators can be found on Use Advanced Search. The exclusive use of + as an operator creates a problem. What if your users want to find documents on, let's say, C++? To cater to such users, you can turn on Special Characters Search. Besides +, you can make the following characters searchable with a toggle. № Searchable Character 1 Ampersand (&) 2 At Sign (@) 3 Greater Than (>) 4 Less Than (<) 5 Dollar ($) 6 Percentage (%) 7 Caret (^) 8 Equals (=) 9 Colon (:) 10 Full stop(.) 11 Forward slash (/) 12 Hyphen (-) 13 Plus (+) 14 Asterisk (*) Any of these characters can be searched outside advanced search queries; 5 > 2 works but # 5 > 2 and # 5 > 2 OR 3 don't. There is an exception to the rule. Special characters can work inside advanced search when they are enclosed in quotes. So, # ""5 > 2"" works. Recommendations Turning on Recommendations adds a section to the search results page where relevant articles are displayed. The articles are different for each query and their relevancy is measured by how many users click them after a query. If a lot of users click articles, X, Y, and Z after a query Q, then X, Y, and Z will populate the Recommendations section for the query Q. Users can find the sections by scrolling down a search results page. Preview Search Results Browse any result in preview mode. When it's on, users can click to view results in a small pane without leaving the search results page. NOTE. The preview pane shows up only when the results are hosted on the same domain and sub domain as the search client, YouTube, or Vimeo. If the search client URL is https://help.domain.com/search.htm, then preview works for all the articles hosted on https://help.domain.com/, YouTube, and Vimeo. Preview panes are available on mobile and Salesforce search clients as well. To turn it on, open the client for editing, go to Configurations, toggle Preview Search Results to the right, and Save. Repeat this for all the search clients for a uniform experience. Preview Search Results improves the Conversions rate because each preview is a conversion. Recent Searches It stores a history of search queries in browser cache and suggests the terms from the history when users are trying to run an old search again. Highlight Viewed Results Set up a different color for the visited hyperlinks. When turn on, it changes the color of clicked results from the default black to violet, which gives a clue to users to avoid repeat clicks on already consulted results. The clicked document stays highlighted, depending upon the user's browser. The values for the most popular browsers are: 90 days in Google Chrome, 180 days in Mozilla Firefox, 365 days in Apple Safari, and 999 days in Microsoft Edge. Similar Search Recommendations Similar to Recommendations (point 3). However, instead of suggesting articles, keywords are recommended. Someone searching for ""data repositories"" on SearchUnify Docs could be suggested ""content sources"" which is the company term for the server where data-to-be-indexed is stored. Similar Search Recommendations analyzes data from multiple users before suggesting a keyword. The suggestions are stored in your browser's cache, so they might be different on the devices you use. Similar searches returns searches on the multiple criteria: Similar search suggestions are based on other users' search behavior, not your current session. To test, log into two different browsers and search for the queries in one browser and can check for the similar searches on the second browser. Note that it takes 24 hours for SU to process data and suggest similar searches to reflect. Similar search suggestions are based on only those search sessions in which at least two search queries have been performed and at least two search results have been clicked. Similar search suggestions work only when at least one document is available for a query. The order in which similar search suggestions are presented is based on the relevancy score. The keywords which helped in providing the best results based on relevancy are shown on the top. Did You Mean? Guide users when they misspell with relevant suggestions from Did You Mean. The feature comes with a standard dictionary and can be taught in-house jargon. Check out Implement Auto-Correct with Did You Mean for details. Redirection URL The web address where the crawler is directed to if the main URL is inaccessible. Knowledge Graph Give answers right on the search page with a knowledge graph, which supports audio-visual content as well. To turn it on, toggle the button to the right and then go to Configure a Knowledge Graph ."

A new search bot for Slack allows you to search your content sources, including Salesforce, Lithium, and Zendesk, across all the channels of a workspace. NOTE. Please talk to SearchUnify if you need a search bot in multiple workspaces. Currently, only one search bot is available for each SearchUnify instance. Do not confuse the search client with the SearchUnify app on Slack App Directory. The latter is merely a demo. You cannot connect any content source with the app or customize it in any other way. Installation Overview Capabilities and Limitations The ability to search enterprise data repositories inside Slack is a huge advantage. It saves time because there is no tab hopping, no cumbersome login screens, and no digressions involved. Users can run @botname <keyword> during a chat to find results immediately. In the next image, the bot name is ""ubermenschen."" Users can also use search operators and filters. The operators work as usual but to iinvoke a filter, a user has to run the command /filters <keyword>. Filters also limited in two ways: Filters don’t update when a value is selected and Merge Facets remains unavailable to admins. Nonetheless, admins can still: Set synonyms Define stopwords Use Create Formula to implement access control Apply keyword tuning Boost entire content sources However, Slack was never designed to be an information retrieval platform. So @botname <keyword> cannot do everything that is possible on a typical search client that you find on websites, Salesforce orgs, and other platforms. For starters, there is no way to change templates or use Designer because the search is a simple textual command without any GUI interface involved. Then, in the absence of a dedicated search page, analytics data is not available. All this means that the services based on analytics and GUI cannot be accessed. These services include: Tuning: Auto Tuning and Custom Tuning Search Client Settings: Change Summary Preferences, Merge Facets, Auto Suggestions, Advertisements, Page Rating, Language Manager, Similar Search Recommendations and Recent Searches Asset Library NLP Manager, Did You Mean?, Suggestion Removal Knowledge Graph Besides, search results are capped at 5 for each query.

A search client can return a million results in response to a search query but if the users have to navigate to page 7, 19, or 173 to find intended documents, then something has gone terribly wrong. It's probably the time to perform some optimization by clever sprinkling of keywords, boost the correct content sources or documents, or educate users on how to search efficiently. To monitor search relevancy for a specific keyword, check out Click Position Report. Key Measures A way to find out how useful search experience is to monitor clicks. When a bulk of the users are clicking the first, second, third, or tenth result; then you can safely assume that the results are relevant. On the other hand, if users navigate to page two and beyond and find documents, then it doesn't bode well for search experience. Average Click Position helps you find out when it's the time to take action. NOTE. In case you want to dive down and discover the keywords for which most clicked documents aren't in the top 10, check out Click Position Report In Average Click Position, two metrics are measured: the number of clicks and the average position of the results that were clicked. If a user clicks on result two and then result seven, then total clicks is 2 and the sum of positions is 2 + 7 = 9. To obtain Average Click Position, the positions are added and then divided by the total number of clicks. From our example where the user clicked results two and seven, Average Click Position can be calculated as in the following algorithm: NOTE. In the equations, Position signifies the rank of the clicked search result. If a user clicks on the 10th result, then Position is 10. Average Click Position is not a constant. You can view how it is changing over time using the Date Range filter in Search Analytics. To cite an example, if Average Click Position is 6.5 in January and rises to 7.5 in February, then share of irrelevant results in search has gone up. However, if Average Click Position drops to 3.1 in March from 7.5 in February, then search experience has improved significantly. To compare, how different search clients are performing on this metric, use the Select Search Client filter. Navigate to the Report In Search Analytics > Overview, select a search client and time period from Select Search Client and Date Range respectively. Scroll down to Average Click Position. Hover the cursor over any point to view the exact number of Successful Searches, Clicks, and Average Click Position for that day, week, or month. The interpretation will depend on Date Range. If Date Range exceeds a month, then each point represents a month. If Date Range is longer than week but shorter than a month, then each point on the line stands for a week. For a Date Range shorter than a week, each point is a day. Download or Share Check out Download and Share an Analytics Report Related Back to Overview Related article on Click Position Report"

You can view search volume (Total Searches), state of documentation coverage (All Searches with Results), and the relevance of search results (All Searches with Clicks). The graph illustrates trends in the searches made in the last five-week period (default) or the period select in Date Range. It captures six metrics: All Searches All Searches with Results (Searches that produced results) All Searches with Clicks (All Searches with at least one click) Unique Searches Unique Searches with Results (Searches that produced results) Unique Searches with Clicks (Unique Searches with at least one click) Each point on the line sums the data for the previous week. The highlighted points have the data for the week starting on 2019-10-07 and ending on 2019-10-13. Search Conversions All searches with clicks are ""search conversions"". A search conversion either occurs or does not occur. There is no middle way. If an end user searches but does not click on any result, then there is no conversion. But if a user clicks—independent of whether the user clicks on one result or all 10—then it is a conversion. Examples. An end user looks up ""salesforce"" and clicks on the results ranked one, two, and four. In such a scenario, but . An end user searches ""today's cases"" and clicks on the top result. In such a scenario, and . An end user queries ""case ID 10231232"" and doesn't click on any result. In this scenario, and . The Search Conversion Rate or Click-Through Rate is the ratio of the number of conversions to the number of either All Searches or Unique Searches.

11,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Search-Analytics/Session-Tracking-Details.htm,Session Tracking Details,"Session Tracking Details The Session Tracking Details report enables Instance Managers (Moderators, Admins, and Super Admin) to view user activity on a search client. The activity is divided into sessions, each of which has a unique ID (Session Identifier). In the report, the sessions are arranged in chronological order; the latest being the first in the list. Besides session start time and session end time, other activities monitored are: Email: The user email. The field can be blank on non-gated platforms and for external users. This field is optional. For details, go to Map User IDs with Emails. Internal User: The user type which distinguishes employees and partners (internal users) from customers (external users). Searches: The total number of searches in a session Clicks: The total number of clicks in a session Cases Logged: The total number of cases logged in a session Support Visit: The field value is ""Yes"" when a user contacts support during a session Start Time: The time (UTC) when a session kicks off End Time: The time (UTC) when a session concludes The last five activity columns (Searches, Clicks, Cases Logged, Support Visit, Start Time, and End Time) are sortable. As highlighted in Fig. 1, the rows can be rearranged by the number of searches; both in their increasing and decreasing order. The number of sessions on a popular search client can quickly run into thousands. To make an admin console user’s job easier, SearchUnify provides two navigation tools: Search Box and Apply Filters. Search Box You can pull up relevant sessions from the search box in three ways: All Text. The default option. It is to be used when you have a query and are interested in finding out the users or the sessions who have looked up that query. To use, write your query in the search box and hit Enter. The report pulls up sessions in which the query is looked up. Exact Match is turned on by default in All Text search. To deactivate, simply uncheck it. Deactivation is valid for a session. The next time you log in, you will find a turned on Exact Match again. Checking and unchecking Exact Match changes search results immediately. Session ID. This option comes in handy when you have a session ID and are interested in viewing the user journey in that particular session. To use, select Session ID from the dropdown, write a session ID, and click Enter. The report will pull up the session. Email . This option is to be used when you are interested in the sessions of a user. To use, select Email from the dropdown, write the user's email, and click Enter. The field supports partial email search, so that you can look up sessions from a domain, such as @searchunify.com, by searching @searchunify.com. The field also supports full and partial local-part search, which means that catsrule@searchunify.com and catsrule@grazitti.com can both be looked up by searching catsrule, cats or rule or any part of catsrule. The report pulls up all the matching sessions. Search supports AND and OR operators, both are case sensitive. Filters Four filters to configure a report are available. Apply Filters Apply Filters is a collection of four filters: (1) Quick Filters, (2) Filter by Activity Type, (3) Show Activity Type, and (4) Content Facets. Quick Filters Quick Filters is a busy admin's best friend. It contains predefined sets of complex filters which can be invoked with a click to refine the Search Tracking Details report. It's important to note that when a quick filter is selected then Filter by Activity Type and Content Facets are disabled. Alternatively, when either Filter by Activity Type or Content Facets are in use, then Quick Filters are disabled. The most common scenarios are covered: Performed search, clicked a result, and visited support (Stage 1) Performed search, no click on results, and visited support (Stage 1) Viewed article directly and visited support (Stage 1) Performed search, clicked a result, and logged a case (Stage 2) Performed search, no click on results, logged a case (Stage 2) Filter By Activity Type Cut the clutter with the four filters. Searches. To view No Search Sessions, check No in Searches. Or, check Yes to exclude No Search Sessions. Clicking all produces both Search Sessions and No Search Sessions. Clicks. The options are All, Yes (limit to Click Sessions), and No (limit to No Click Sessions). Support Visit. The options are All, Yes (only the sessions in which support was contacted), and No (only the sessions in which support wasn't contacted). Cases Logged. The options are All, Yes (only those sessions in which a ticket was raised), and No (only those sessions in which a ticket was raised). Show Activity Type Each session ID is clickable. A dialog opens when you click an ID. In the default state, the dialog contains all user journey measures—explained in the session Key Measures—such as search queries and clicks. As an admin, you can customize the details in the dialog by checking the details you need in Show Activity Type. The selection affects report downloads as well, which means that if you have checked only Clicks in Show Activity Type then the downloaded file will have only clicks data. The available activity types are: All Activities Viewed Page Text Searched Clicked Search Result Visited Support Case Deflection Content Facets How do you find the search sessions in which a Salesforce case is opened? What about getting a list of the sessions in which a YouTube video receives a click? Content Facets puts such data on your fingertips. To set up Content Facets, go to Search Clients > Edit > Content Sources. Then, in the Track Analytics column, check the content fields for which data is to be tracked. For illustration, the Category field has been checked. In our example, Category holds only two: FAQs and Apps. You can spot them in the next image. But your content field, can hold hundreds or even thousands of values. For example, in a knowledge base, the field author_name can contain a few dozen values and the field tag can contain a few thousand values. In the image, FAQs is 35 and of Apps is 90. It means that 35 users clicked a document in the FAQs category and 90 users click a document in the Apps category. Users don't have to check a facet. Through Content Facets, admins can learn which categories, tags, authors, or another fields are relatively popular. Key Measures Session Identifier A session is a continuous period of user activity. To differentiate sessions from one another, each session is assigned an ID or Session Identifier. Click the ID to open a dialog that lists all the tracking activities in Activity Type, a summary of those activities in Activity Detail. This column also contains case subjects after a vertical bar (|) when a case is created. IMAGE The time of activities is captured in the third column, Time, while the fourth column, Page No shows the search page on which a click occurred. This column is blank, unless Activity Type is Text Searched or Text Searched (Support Page). The fields in Activity Type can be controlled from All Activities (filter). For searches, details include the query. For clicks, the URL of the clicked page. And for cases, the case subject. The searches on the global search page are gathered in Activity Type ""Text Searched"". Searches It records the number of searches made in that particular session. Clicks It records the number of clicks on the produced results. Cases Logged Here you will find any cases that get logged during a session. Support Visit It answers if a user visited support during the active session. Start Time It records the time when the session started. End Time It records the time when the session ended. Download and Share a Report The instructions are on Download and Share an Analytics Report.

SearchUnify Goes Mobile With the onset of Boomslang ’18, we are extending our support to mobile phones, tablets, etc. On mobile devices, SearchUnify will be supporting browsers including Google Chrome and Safari. We are actively working on adding more & more browsers. We recommend using the latest versions of the above-mentioned browsers for a more fluid experience. Admin Panel Gets a Fresh, New Look Enhancing the user experience for the admin panel was one of the primary objectives of Boomslang ’18. To achieve this feat, we incorporated a number of changes: Say Hi to Happy UI: The first change you will notice is the brand-new UI, which renders the whole console a lively and energetic face. Play with Drag & Drop Graphs: All the facets on the ‘Dashboard’ now come with drag & drop functionality which enables users to reorganize the dashboard and prioritize graphs, tables, or charts that better suit their needs. Update Configurations in a Jiffy: The various forms present throughout the console are now more user-centric and convenient. More Repositories, Twice the Fun! In a bid to offer out-of-the-box connectivity for every major enterprise platform available out there, we have added some new connectors to our existing fleet of content sources. These additions are mentioned below: - SharePoint GitHub Stack Overflow Box Google Drive Zendesk Slack YouTube Help Scout Furthermore, there is a lot you can do under the ‘Content Sources’ section now. More Secure Authentication with OAuth: With the added support for OAuth-based authentication, you can effortlessly connect compatible content sources without putting your enterprise data security at risk. Broader Sync Frequency Band: You now have more options while selecting the sync frequency for different repositories. These include minutes, hours, daily, weekly, monthly, a particular day of week or month, annually, or even never. As a result, you save API calls or avert excessive load on content servers. Easily Tweak Search Rules: Setting search rules for respective repositories is now more lucid and easy with the availability of auto-population for most fields. This allows you to exercise more control on the information that indexed by choosing subsets of content source such as channels, space, boards, folders, etc. Behold, Search Client 2.0 This has been one of the focus areas of the release and comprehensive list of updates suggests the same. We have worked on improving the UX for configuring the search bar and simplified the whole process. The additions or enhancements are listed below: HTML Editor Support: Earlier, the search results page was customizable via CSS. Now, you can also tweak it by writing HTML code as well. In case you are using multiple search clients, then you can independently configure every one of them as per your need. Clone Search Client: Leverage already chosen settings from a previously configured search client by simply cloning it and fine tuning it. Stock Templates for Results Page: You also have an option to leverage built-in templates for your search pages for blazing fast implementation. Preview and Select Best Results: For search clients on websites, you now have an option to preview results on search results page itself. This helps search users to instantly identify useful content. Strengthened Formula Editor: Formula Editor allows you to control search results by restricting certain content pieces from a content resource for particular audiences. Analytics Settings for Individual Search Client: Now you can separately choose search analytics you want for individual search clients. More Cognitive Force AI, machine learning, and NLP have been an integral part of our algorithm since our first day in the industry. Unlike other solutions, we actively use these technologies to foster enterprise growth and customer success. With Boomslang ’18, things are about to get better. All three core technologies have started working in harmony to deliver optimized and problem-solving answers. Intelligent Recommendations: We have added ‘Recommendation Widget’ to SearchUnify’s arsenal. It merges search query and common user browsing pattern to find and recommend useful pieces. This feature can be turned on or off in the Search Client’s settings. Opening Doors to Synonym Factory: We have launched Auto Synonyms. In the ‘Manage Synonyms’ section, AI & machine learning proactively operate to automatically observe search behaviour and suggest additional synonyms for a better search experience. Automated Facet-based Personalization: We have reconfigured our algorithm to better personalize results for individual users based on their facets selection history. Machine learning keeps track of user’s facet preference and optimize results accordingly. Dive Deeper Into Analytics Analytics has always been our forte. In order to continue our strides towards delivering business intelligence, we have upped the ante. The forthcoming bullets explain how: Track User Journey via Keywords: First things first, you can now click on individual keywords on the Most Searched Keywords mesh cloud on ‘Dashboard’ to instantly drill down on user journeys and understand what worked for them. Search Traffic vs Conversion Consolidated Graph: Search Analytics now offer a consolidated view of search and conversion count under the moniker ‘Search Hit Count’ in ‘Search Analytics’ tab. This helps you closely evaluate content and search performance. Top Searches with No Clicks: In addition to queries with no results, the console now also identifies searches with results but no conversion. This helps create content which the users actively seek, thereby bridging content gaps and generating more conversions. You can find this report in ‘Content Gap Analysis’ tab in ‘Analytics’ section. Analytics REST API: We now support an enhanced REST API which allows you to consume SearchUnify analytics in other platforms as well. Amped up Click Chain Reporting: Click chain reporting has been enhanced to paint a more accurate and comprehensible picture of user search journey. Downloadable Reports in Excel: Every analytical chart from the console can now be exported to Excel in addition to CSV with a click of a button. You just need to hit the ‘Download’ button against the respective client. What are the advantages of the above-mentioned changes? More insights, better ROI, and smarter decisions, and effective optimization to name some. Enhanced Control Over Results & Relevancy Controlling search results has always been one of the key necessities of our customers. To continue surpassing their expectations, we have further improved the search tuning function and search results. We have introduced many new parameters for you to better optimize search results. They are mentioned in the following points: Search Tuning by Search Client: Now you can separately fine tune search results for every search client. This helps you optimize search results for different end users who may be leveraging different search clients. Introducing Stop Words: The ability to manage stop words further strengthens search and ensures such words do not alter the results & dampen the user experience. Configurable Automatic Boosting: Staying true to our cognitive roots, we have added the option of configuring Automatic Boosting. This helps you to tap on the AI-based algorithms when system has a decent search experience under its belt and starts evolving by every search query. Custom boosting: This allows you to boost content on the basis of multiple options such as content age, solved discussions, etc. Other Advances to Make Your Day There are several other changes which aim to make your life easier. Admin Audit Trail: We have enabled Audit Trail in SearchUnify which provides you a detailed report on all admin activity in console. Blacklist URLs from a Website: Now, you can blacklist particular URLs when crawling a website so that they are not part of search results. Overhauled Knowledge Bases: A new help center and community are now up and running. They will be also functioning as our idea factory and place-to-be for discussions.

29,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Content-Sources/Website.htm,Website,"Use a Website as a Content Source Submitting a website to a web search engine is relatively straightforward. Simply submit a sitemap to Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, or another search engine. The simplicity, however, comes at a cost. Besides a robots.txt file, which tells search engines what not to index, there is little webmasters can do to customize crawling and indexing. Advanced configurations—such as limiting crawl and index only to titles, headings, or the content in a particular div—are lacking. SearchUnify is different. Webmasters (known as Admins in the SearchUnify realm) can upload a sitemap to index a website or configure a highly customized crawling plan that allows them to: Crawl and index multiple public and gated websites simultaneously (although not the ones behind a captcha wall) Control the depth of crawl Crawl and index websites in languages other than English (more than 20 languages supported) Crawl and index websites that rely on JavaScript to function properly Three Stages of Website Crawling This article covers how SearchUnify can be used to crawl and index almost any website. The entire process consists of three stages, which are first summarized and then laid out. Establish a connection with the website. It's here that an admin Uploads a sitemap or inserts a website address in the URL field to specify the website(s) to be crawled Inserts an integer in Depth and toggles Limit Crawling to SiteMap to define crawl depth Specifies whether a website is public or gated through the Authentication Method dropdown Defines the role of JavaScript on a website's functionality in JavaScript Enabled Crawling Gives an internal (to be used in the SearchUnify instance) name to the website in Name Set up crawl frequency. In contrast to mainstream web search engines, whose crawl rate depends on how often updates are pushed to the website in consideration, SearchUnify admins can set up a crawl frequency ranging from every 24 hours to once in a year. Irrespective of the Frequency, the first crawl is manual. Define what is to be crawled. On top of specifying what URLs to crawl and what to avoid, admins can mention precisely what data to crawl by specifying the tags in which that data is stored. The usage requires some familiarity with HTML and CSS selectors. Stage 1: Establish a Connection From Content Sources in main navigation, go to Add a Content Source. Find website from the search box and click Add. Selecting Website takes you to the Authentication screen, where seven—actually nine if you count each authentication method separately—connection settings are available. Next, each field on the screen is explained. Understand the Authentication Screen Name Each content source in an instance has a name, which helps admins distinguish one from another. A good practice is to enter a descriptive term, such as ""Public Setup Tutorials on YouTube"" or ""Promotional Videos on YouTube"", in the Name field. ⚠ IMPORTANT In the Name field, the only characters allowed are lowercase, uppercase, and spaces. Note that a space at the end of a name will throw an error. Public Setup Tutorials on YouTube is correct but Public Setup Tutorials on YouTube "" (notice the trailing space) is not. URL Right next to Name is the URL field, which can be used in two ways: An admin can insert the address of the website to be crawled or the URL of the sitemap. A typical website address will be for the form: https://searchunify.com/ and a sitemap might look like https://docs.searchunify.com/Sitemap.xml. Don't forget to enter http (if the website is unsecure) or https (if the website is secure). An admin can upload a TXT or an XML file using the upload button () on the right end of the URL field. The uploaded file will contain one of the following: Links; one link on each line Sitemap.xml Sitemap.xml Capabilities Uploading a sitemap offers several advantages. The primary two are: Accelerated Recrawls. SearchUnify crawler identifies the URLs in a sitemap with the attribute <lastmod> and crawls only the pages updated or created since the last crawl. This type of crawling can be several times faster on a large website. Related: Generate a Sitemap from URL (loc) and Last Modified (lastmod) Attributes (Requires a login to the SearchUnify Community) Customer Filters. Admins can add custom attributes, such as <author>, <priority> for each URL in the sitemap. After crawling, these customer attributes can be used as filters on a search client. To index a filter, use the format {{sitemap}}{{filterName}} in Rules. SearchUnify is capable of handling complex sitemaps which contain more than just a list of plain URLs. One such feature is the tag <lastmod>. ⚠ WARNING. SearchUnify doesn't crawl a website when the links in the sitemap.xml or TXT file doesn't match with real web addresses. Five common issues are: Redirects. If a link redirects, it will not be crawled. HTTPS and HTTP. If a website is secure, then crawling will proceed only when sitemap.xml or TXT file contain secure links; starting with HTTPS. If a website is insecure, then HTTP links will work. In both cases, the web addresses should be exactly the same. Trailing Spaces. Any space after the end of a URL causes the indexing to stop. Comments. If there are any comments in the TXT file or sitemap.xml, remove them before the upload. Empty Lines. Indexing can stop abruptly if empty lines are found in the beginning, middle, or end of a TXT file or sitemap.xml. Depth If you are uploading a TXT file or Inserting a URL, then specify Depth. Else, for sitemap.xml, keep Depth equals to one. When Depth is one, SearchUnify crawls the links in the URL field or the TXT file. When Depth is two, SearchUnify follows the hyperlinks on the webpages in the URL field or the TXT file and crawls them as well. The recommended value of Depth is less than 10. JavaScript Enable Crawling Some websites rely on JavaScript to function while others, such as Wikipedia, can function without it. If the content source website is dependent on JavaScript, then toggle JavaScript Enable Crawling on. Else, keep it turned off. A way to find out if a website depends on JavaScript for its regular functions is to go to Chrome://settings/content/javascript, turn off JavaScript. Reload the website. If you receive an error message or the website starts behaving erratically, then turn on JavaScript Enabled Crawling. Else, leave the function in its default state. Authentication Method The settings described in the first two sections are adequate if the content source is a public website, such as Wikipedia or SearchUnify Docs. A public website is any website that is accessible to anyone with an Internet connection and the web address. If you website is public, click Connect and jump to the section Frequency. However, if your content source is a website that requires users log in before they can view an article, a video, or another content, you will see to configure security settings as well. The configurations are found in Authentication Method can be of the type Basic or Form. ⚠ IMPORTANT. Gated websites cannot be crawled and indexed until Basic and Form are set up. Basic Select Basic from the Authentication Method dropdown if the website requires users to enter their username and password. Two new fields will appear. Enter a valid ID and password and click Connect. ⚠ IMPORTANT. If there is a captcha on the login form, then your website will not be crawled. Form Form is an advanced version of Basic and requires an acquaintance, on part of the SearchUnify admin, with CSS selectors to set up. You can think of them as guideposts which tell a browser how to interpret data. Consider the next image where a pair of <h1> tags tells browser to interpret the text contained within them as a heading and a pair <p> tags tells the browser to interpret the text contained with them as a paragraph. Both are CSS selectors. When Form is selected, then an admin has to specify, besides the username and password: Login URL CSS selectors of the username field CSS selector of the password field CSS selector of the login button Login URL is straightforward. A quick way to find the CSS selectors is to press Ctrl+Shift+I if you are using Chrome and hover the cursor over the each field and button one at a time. In the next image, you can see the CSS selector of username, which is #username. Stage 2: Set up Crawl Frequency The first crawl is always manual. After that you can set up a crawl frequency. When a sitemap.xml with a <lastmod> tag is used, the crawls are faster because only the web pages updated or added since the last crawl are indexed. In case or website URL or a TXT file, the entire website is indexed during each crawl. Stage 3: Select Fields for Indexing SearchUnify indexes a website by capturing and storing the data inside HTML elements. ⚠ IMPORTANT A website is not indexed if no HTML element is specified. The admins can write CSS selectors to specify the elements for indexing. The CSS selectors are stored in an Object, which we will create next. Give your Object a Name and a Label. The name and the label do not have to be valid HTML tags. Click Add Object to create an empty object. Click to add content fields for indexing. Selector is the most important field. HTML tags, classes, and IDs are valid selectors. IDs are preceded by an # (octothorpe), classes by a . (dot), but the standard HTML tags are not surrounded by angle brackets. Assign the Selector a Type. Give the selector a Name and Label. Select Multiple to treat each instance of a matched HTML element separate in search, or Single to combine their data into a field. Press Add and then Save. Switch to By Filter. Next, the four fields in URL Filter Configuration enable admins to highly customize crawling. Should crawl. Enter both the secure and insecure addresses of the webpage that was mentioned in Authentication Should not crawl. Enter the secure and insecure addresses of the webpages that should not be crawled. Outlink filters for URL. These websites are cawled to the second Depth. It means that the webpages linked to are crawled as well. Indexing filters for URL. Same as Should Crawl, but with a carel appended to the left end. Press Save. You have successfully added Website as a content source."

34,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Developer-Guides/Middleware.htm,Middleware,"Secure a Web Search Client with Middleware If you are going to implement SearchUnify on a gated platform, you can greatly enhance search client security by leveraging the platform’s authentication layer with SearchUnify SDK. ""Leverage"" here means that if there is already a system in place to authenticate users, the same system can be extended to authenticate users before they can find the search client. Data Flow Extending an existing system is faster and more secure than creating a separate authentication mechanism from scratch because roles, permissions, profiles, and everything else is already in place. Once the Middleware has been set up, the extended system, instead of an end-user, sends queries to SearchUnify search API. The next GIF showcases the data flow. Your browser does not support the video tag. End user logs in and runs a query on a search client (User Front End). The customer authentication system (Customer Backend) validates the user credentials. If the credentials are correct, Customer Backend sends the search query to SearchUnify. SearchUnify returns results to Customer Backend which are then displayed on User Front End. Prerequisites Before configuring your website, you need to make sure that the below steps are followed. Create a secure route that can connect with the SearchUnify search results page. For example: yourwebsite/api/su/search. Note down the authentication headers required to verify a user and connect with the SearchUnify SDK Prepare SU Instance Go to Search Clients and click open a gated search client for customization. In the JS tab, update the API in the functions makeSearchCall() and getAutocompleteResults(). In place of the API, insert the authentication headers of your platform that will be used in AJAX calls. The headers help your servers validate requests. var req = { method: 'POST', url: 'customer_url/api/searchunify/search', header: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + localStorage.getItem('param') }, data: queryPassed } $http(req).then(function successCallBack(res) { resolve(res); }); Initiate SU SDK on Server SearchUnify provides SDK for JavaScript. Using the SDK, you can route search requests. To start using, initialize the SDK with your URL and API key. NodeJS Servers For NodeJS servers, use the following code snippet create a route, initialize the SDK and use SDK’s search method. Please contact your customer support agent for the API key and SDK. const { SearchUnifyApiClient } = require('su-sdk'); const apiKey = ""key""; const instanceUrl = 'https://api.searchunify.com'; const searchunify = new SearchUnifyApiClient(instanceUrl, apiKey); server.post(""/api/searchunify/search"", async (req, res, next) => { try { let response = await searchunify.search(req.body); return res.json(response); } catch (error) { console.log('Exception ${error.message}'); return res.status(422).json ({status: false, message: ""error message"" }); } })'"
35,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Developer-Guides/Search.htm,Search API,"Search API Get search results data in JSON. Prerequisites Ensure that you have fulfilled the prerequisites before making your first call. 1. Set a user scope SearchUnify users can have one of these five scopes. Each scope has an impact on the calls a user can make. The instructions to change user scope are in Change User Scope. 2. Create an app At the time of creating an app, you obtain a client ID and client secret. Both are used to ascertain your identity. The process of creating an app has been explained in Get Client ID and Client Secret with an API App. 3. Obtain access and refresh tokens using the app Access and a refresh tokens are required to be able to use the search API. The process of generating these tokens has been explained in Get Access and Refresh Token Using curl. Using Access and Refresh Tokens The token generation call produces two kinds of tokens: Refresh and Access. Refresh tokens don't expire until they are revoked by SearchUnify. Store them securely. The sole use of refresh tokens is to generate access tokens. Access tokens expire every four hours. They authenticate users. It is mandatory to include them in the header of your API calls. The format is -H ""authorization: Bearer {{access token}}"" . Base URL https://{{hostname}}/api/v2_search/ The hostname is the URL of your SearchUnify instance. Example Base URL https://mycompany.searchunify.com/api/v2_search/ Endpoints POST /searchResults View search results on a platform of your choice. Parameters Parameter Optional / Required Description Data Type uid Required It is your search client ID. You can find it in Search Clients > UID (column). string searchString Required It is the search query. string email Optional This parameter is used establish the searcher's identity and tailor search results based on that identity. An admin email might fetch results different from a moderator email. string orderBy Optional It has two values, asc and desc. If orderby=desc, then the order in which the results are presented is reversed. The last result will be ranked first, the penultimate result second, and so on. The default value of orderBy is asc. string sortby Optional It can have two values, _score or _post_time. When sortby=_score, then the documents with the highest score are presented first. When sortby=_post_time, then the lastest documents are on top. string exactPhrase Optional It treats all the words in the search query as one contiguous string. exactPhrase=salesforce console becomes ""salesforce console"". string withOneOrMore Optional When used, it inserts the Boolean operator OR between each pair of keywords. withOneOrMore=salesforce console becomes ""salesforce OR console"". string withoutTheWords Optional This parameter inserts the Boolean operator NOT before each keyword. withoutTheWords=salesforce console becomes ""NOT salesforce NOT console"" string from Optional It's an offset. If from=""10"", then the call will ignore the top 10 results and fetch results starting from the document ranked 11. string resultsPerPage Optional If resultsPerPage=30, then each search will produce 30 results on each page. string indexEnabled Optional The content sources tabs are hidden if indexEnabled is set to false. In the default state, indexEnabled=true. boolean aggregations Optional aggregations is used to refine your search with facets. For example: type: ${facet name}, filter: [ ${facet filter name1}, ${facet filter name2} ]. A common pattern for nested facets is [{type: ${facet name},children: [ childname: ${facet child name1}, level: ${facet level} ]}] object pagingAggregation Optional It is used if your goal is to display all your facets. {key: ${facet name},keyword: ${facet search keyword},offset: ${number of filters to shown}} object pageNo Optional Returns search results from the specified page number. If pageNo==5, then the results from the fifth page will be returned. sid Optional Attaches session ID(s) to the returned data. language Optional Returns results in the specified language. language=zh returns Chinese results. versionResults Optional Merge multiple versions of a doc into a result. getAutoTunedResult Optional Returns auto tuned results.

39,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/End-User-Personalization/Use-Advanced-Search.htm,Use-Advanced-Search,"Skip To Main Content Account Settings Logout placeholder Account Settings Logout Filter: All Files Submit Search Use Advanced Search Refine your searches with search operators and the advanced search filter to find what you are looking for in less time. SearchUnify provides three Boolean operators, an exact match capability, and two wildcards—the first for terms and the second characters. To use an operator, prefix your search query with an octothorpe (#) and space. Example Search Query # salesforce NOT lithium finds all documents that have the keyword salesforce but don't have the keyword lithium. NOTE. An operator works on the word following it. To use an operator on a phrase, either enclose the phrase in double quotes or use parenthesis. Examples: # community NOT ""china programmers"": Find documents with the term community, but without the phrase ""china programmers"". # community NOT china programmers: Find documents with the terms community and programmers but not china # community NOT (china AND programmers): Find documents with the terms community, but neither china nor programmers. Search Operators AND or && Returns documents containing the terms or phrases on the left and right of AND. The operator is interchangeable with &&. Although AND is used in the examples, you can swap it with && without impacting search. Examples: # content AND source AND DYNAMICS (Find documents that have all three keywords in them: content, source, and dynamics, irrespective of the order. Case has no impact on search. DYNAMICS, dynamics, Dynamics, and dYNaMiCs are all processed identically.) # ""content source"" AND dynamics (Find documents that have the phrase content source and the keyword dynamics.) A second way to run a phrase search is to use parenthesis. # (content source) AND dynamics finds all the documents that have the phrase content source and the keyword dynamics. # content source AND dynamics (Find documents that have the keyword source and the keyword dynamics.) # content source AND dynamics client (Find documents that have two keywords. The first is either content or source and the second is either dynamics or client.) OR or || Finds documents containing either of the terms or phrases around OR. The operator is interchangeable with ||. Although OR is used in the examples, you can swap it with || without impacting search. # searchunify OR su OR SFY (Find documents that at least one of these three keywords: searchunify, su, and SFY.) OR can be clubbed with ANDfor complex queries, such as # blog AND (searchunify OR su) returns documents which have blog and either searchunify or su. SearchUnify processes uppercase and lowercase words in the same manner, so there is no difference between SFY, sfy, and SFy. # ""content source"" OR dynamics (Find documents that have the phrase content source or the keyword dynamics or both.) A second way to run a phrase search is to use parenthesis. # (content source) OR dynamics finds all the documents that have either the phrase content source or the keyword dynamics or both. # content source OR dynamics (Find documents that have either a keyword from content and source or the keyword dynamics.) # content source AND dynamics client (Find documents that either of two keywords. The first is either content or source and the second is either dynamics or client.) NOT or - or ! Excludes documents that contain the term or phrase followed by NOT. The operator is interchangeable with - and !. Although NOT is used in the examples, you can swap it with - or !without impacting search. # Release NOT Mamba or #Release NOT Mamba finds documents that have the keyword Release but not the keyword Mamba. A space after # and case has no impact on the search operator. # Salesforce Service NOT Console finds documents that have either Salesforce and Service but not Console. However, # Console NOT (Salesforce Service) finds documents but not Service Services. Keywords between double quotes and parenthesis are considered as exact phrases. # Salesforce NOT Services NOT Console finds documents that Salesforce but neither of Services and Console. "" "" Double quotes are used to look up phrases as they are. ""install searchunify"" finds documents that have the phrase install searchunify in that specific order. A document with only the phrase searchunify install is not returned. ? and * The question mark is a placeholder for a character and the asterisk for a phrase. # a?l finds documents with three letter words whose first letter is A and the last letter is L. The second letter can be any letter or number. Therefore, each of the following keywords match all, awl, and AOL. # search* finds documents with keywords that have search in them. When # search* is run, documents with the keywords, such as searches, searching, and searched, are returned. + Limits the search to documents that contain the term or phrase following +. # mamba +20 (Find documents that necessarily have the keyword ""20"", along with ""mamba"".) Advanced Search Form The most frequently used operators have been added to Advanced Search. Run a search. Use the search drop down to refine your query. Three options are available: With the Exact Phrase. The query will be searched as it is. A search for ""recognise"" will not find the documents with the spelling ""recognize."" This option doesn't affect queries in language such as Chinese and English where words don't decline that much, but in languages such as Russian and Korean, the results can be significantly different. With One or More Words. All the documents containing even one word from the multiword query will be returned. ""fast food"" will return documents containing the terms ""fast"", ""food"", and ""fast food."" Without the Words. The documents containing the query will be excluded. This is equivalent to adding a hyphen in front of a query in the search box. # fast -food find all documents with a mention of ""fast"" but without ""food."" Advanced filters in use are displayed on a search results page as well. Other Features Results Per Page View up to 25 results right on the first search page, up from the default 10. Scroll down to find Results Per Page and select from 10, 15, 20, or 25. The settings will be saved in session history. It means that you will see the preferred number of results during the entire session. To return to the default number, start a new session. The setting is available on all search clients and works on all devices. You have already seen Results Per Page on desktops. The next images show how Results Per Page looks like on mobile devices and in Salesforce Console. Facet Search Facets are a great way to narrow the scope of your search.

45,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Content-Sources/Content-Annotation.htm,Automatic Text Classification with Content Annotation,"Automatic Text Classification with Content Annotation Content Annotation in Content Sources is used to categorize data into predefined categories. A popular use-case is to tag threads on a community with product names. To understand how it works, assume a small community with only 10 threads: 1. susePhone doesn't boot, 2. ZacPC doesn't launch browser, 3. How to install Upera in susePhone?, 4. Siresox is slow, 5. Unable to make calls from susePhone, 6. How to install Siresox on a susePhone?, 7.

It's not feasible to hire a person to tag large community with 10,000 or even a million threads. But with Content Annotation, you can apply a set of tags on a content source. The tags are defined in Taxonomy, where using a controlled vocabulary, an SU Admin defines Entities and Values. Check out the article, Taxonomy, for the definitions and instructions on how to add tags. This article walks you through the process of applying an already defined set of tags to a content source. Apply Taxonomy to Content Source From Content Sources, go to Content Annotation. Click Add Annotation Rule. Select the Content Source and Content Object where tagging is going to be applied. From Select Entity Type, pick an entity from Taxonomy. If you haven't already, define entities and values. The instructions are on Taxonomy. The values described in Taxonomy can be supplemented with content sources fields. To group together Taxonomy values and content fields, specify the fields. Taxonomy values are grouped together as a facet. Name the facet in Content Field Name and Label. Click Send Annotation Request.

10,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Apps/Escalation-Predictor-Dashboard.htm,Escalation Predictor Dashboard,"Escalation Predictor Dashboard: Analytics Escalations Dashboard predicts the likelihood of escalations on incoming cases. The probability is expressed through a number—where 0% means the case will not escalate and 100% guarantees an escalation—and one of these three emoticons: (irate user), (usual user), and (content user). Clicking the emoticon on a row expands the row, showcasing the snippets associated with an emoticon. Expansion is a great time-saver for SU Admins who don't have to skim through entire case bodies to figure out why a particular customer is content or unhappy. Expansion highlights the snippets exuding customer reaction. The other columns in the report (from left to right) are: # (Number), Case Number, Case Title, Created Date, Email, and Likelihood to Escalate. Out of these columns, Created Date is sortable. The only critical setting on this screen is the Minimum Threshold box. Too low a number floods the screen with cases and by placing too high a number, you miss letting imminent escalations slip under the radar. Email, Download, and Alerts The data on Escalations Dashboard can be emailed and downloaded. You can also set up hourly, weekly, and monthly alerts on potential escalations. To send email Escalations Dashboard data, click . From Select Date Range, pick a time period. The data for the selected period is emailed. In the second field, Email Address, write the email addresses of the people who are to receive the data potential escalations data. Finally, click Send. A CSV file with the subject ""SearchUnify: Escalation Prediction Analytics"" is send to each person mentioned in Email Address. Click Download Open the file in Excel, Sublime, or a similar program. The file ought to have five columns: Case Number, Case Title, Created Date, Contact Email, and Escalate Score. Download works like Email. The only difference being that instead of sending data over email, it is downloaded to your device's hard-disk. To start, click . Pick a time period from Select Data Range and click Download. A CSV file is downloaded. Open the file in Excel, Sublime, or a similar program. The file ought to have five columns: Case Number, Case Title, Created Date, Contact Email, and Escalate Score. Both Email and Download are great to find out potential escalations at any point in time. Alerts serves a different purpose. Instead of having to log into your instance, you get emails on set intervals, which can be Hourly, Daily, on Monthly. At the end of the set interval, an email is shot to subscribers sharing with them Escalations Dashboard data in a CSV file, just as it is the case with Email and Download. To start, click . Alternatively, you can email and download this data as well. Configure the time interval in Set Frequency and in Email Address write the email addresses of the people who are to receive the alerts. Then, click Send. People who receive emails are Subscribed Emails. There can be a maximum of five Subscribed Emails in an instance."

The app consists of two sections: Escalation Dashboard and Reports. Escalation Dashboard The first section in the Escalation Dashboard report is Cases Likely to Escalate. The list features eight different columns like: Case Number. Salesforce case ID. Case Title. Case subject in Salesforce. Agent. Name of the support agent who answerable for the case. Owner. Name of the person who raised the case. Created Date. Date and time on which the case was created Last updated. Date and time on which the case was last updated Likelihood to Escalate. Probability that the case will see an escalation. Several factors contribute to identify the escalation percentage. On clicking a case from the Escalation dashboard, you are redirected to a new page where details of the case and the individual factors being considered to calculate escalation are listed. These factors include; priority, case creation date, type, case modified date, etc. These factors would vary from case to case. A certain weight is defined for different factors, based on which the escalation percentage is counted. For instance, ‘priority' can get 20%, ‘case creation date’ 10% percent, and ‘type’ 10% percent. Action/Status. Record of what has been done to prevent an escalation. It has two values: Acknowledged and Rejected. Select Acknowledged if you are taking steps to prevent an escalation. Select Reject if you notice a false flag and think the case isn't going to escalate. The second section in this report features a list of Escalated Cases, meaning the cases that have already been escalated. The list is segmented into six different columns: Case Number, Case Title, Agent, Owner, Created Date, and Last updated. The Salesforce version of the report features three new filters: Agent Filter allows you to pull up cases by agent. Select an agent’s name to find all the cases the agent has worked on. The pulled up cases are segmented into two parts: Escalated Cases and Cases Likely to be Escalated. Owner Filter allows you to pull up cases by owner. Select an owner’s name to find all the cases the owner has created. The pulled up cases are segmented into two parts: Escalated Cases and Cases Likely to be Escalated. Filter by Status allows you to pull up cases in one of the three states: All, Acknowledged, and Rejected. Reports The reports in this section have been documented in Escalation Predictor Dashboard: Analytics. The only report exclusive to Salesforce is: Case Owner Report. Under the reports tab is a Case Owner section where you can see a list of case owners. The report has four columns: Contact Name. Name of the case owner Contact Email. Email address of the case owner Case Logged. The total number of cases that the case owner has created Escalation. Percentage of cases that were escalated for the case owner"
12,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Search-Tuning/Custom.htm,Custom,"Custom Tuning: Boost Articles Based on Keyword Match in a Field This article shows you how you can personalize results on a search client by boosting documents based on any or all of these four factors: Solved (Discussion status) Title (Keyword match in titles) Click Boosting Base (Popularity) Decay Rate (Age) To view any custom settings, select a search client and toggle Custom Boosting to the right. Solved It works only on communities. When a user runs a search and more than one discussion threads are found to be equally relevant, then the threads with the status solved can be displayed before unresolved threads. The nudge can be weak or strong; its potency depending on the multiplier picked from the Solved slider. The multiplier 1 has no impact on solved threads. Any other value increases the relevancy score of solved threads times. Title Title takes advantage of keyword matches. You can match Title with any object field. If a keyword matches one or more words in the Title of a document, then that document can be pushed to (or near) the top of search results. This is done by inflating its relevancy score. Admins can increase relevancy scores by moving the Title slider. As was the case with Solved, the multiplier 1 has no impact but any other value increases the relevancy score of a document in case of a title match times. Title is turned off by default. Please write to your SearchUnify representative to turn it on. Don't forget to mention the object field you wish to map Title to in your email. Click Boosting Rate When set up, Click Boosting Rate displays more popular documents ahead of their less popular counterparts. Admins can control the frequency at which popular documents appear in search. In the default set up, if a document has been clicked on times for a keyword , then 's relevancy score increases approximately times for that keyword. As an admin, you can define a new boost rate. To do that, click anywhere in the Click Boosting Base box and replace 10 with another integer. Hovering your cursor over will show you the new, increased rates. In the default set up, the clicks from all the search clients count. If you have two main search clients set up, one for employees and another for customers, then the clicks from both search clients will count. But admins can change the default setting to include clicks from only the selected search client. You might want to do that when you don't want customers' decisions affecting the search results on the employees' search client and vice versa. Another reason could be the people in your marketing and sales who don't want the choices of one demographic spilling into the experiences of another. A way to limit clicks to a search client is to uncheck Include Clicks from All Search Clients, which is already selected. Attach to Case Boosting Attach to Case Boosting is similar to Click Boosting Rate but three crucial differences: Attach to Case Boosting works only on Salesforce Attach to Case Boosting works only when its almost eponymous SearchUnify addon is set up on a Salesforce org Instead of counting the number of clicks, Attach to Case Boosting considers how many times support rep link an article to a case. The more often an article is linked, the higher will be its probability of appearing in search. As in Click Boosting Rate, you can select how quickly an article can rise in results. Date Boosting In its default state, SearchUnify serves new documents first. A version named D.1.1 is more likely to be put ahead of D.1.0, D.0.9, and older versions. An as admin, you can increase the probability from ""more likely"" to ""almost always."" The idea is to increase the relevance score gap between the latest version and old versions by reducing the relevancy of old versions. Each newly updated document has a score and it remains for a time period, called Offset. You can select an Offset value in the 1-month to 3-year range. Once Offset has passed, begins to drop. It continues to drop for a time period, known as Scale. Scale can be as short as a month or as long as three years. Use the dropdown to select a value for Scale. The rate of drop of relevance score during Scale is controlled by Decay Rate, which you can enter in the Decay Rate box or arrive at from moving the slider. At the end of first Scale, the new relevancy score equals and the entire process starts again and goes on ad infinitum."
13,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Search-Tuning/Enable-Auto-Spell-Corrector.htm,Enable Auto Spell Corrector,"Enable Auto Spell Corrector A search for ""moniter"" on most search clients will fetch zero results. But if a user, on realizing his or her mistake, looks up ""monitor"" next then SearchUnify can infer that ""moniter"" is ""monitor"" misspelled. Once a deduction has been made, SearchUnify will automatically correct each instance of ""moniter"" in subsequent sessions. Detect Incorrect Queries But the mystery is: How does a search client distinguish a correct query from a misspelled one? For straightforward terms that are misspelled, such as ""komputer"" and ""queuee"", there are standard dictionaries to take care of them. A much bigger and pertinent problem for businesses is to find a search engine that will identify and correct the jargon used in their field. For instance, oAuth and 256-byte TLI for an organization. SearchUnify offers a solution. Once set up, Enable Auto Spell Correcter rummages through select content fields to learn jargon and offer relevant suggestions when an employee or customer misspells a query. Sticking with the example, if all the products developed or sold by an organization are in Database (content source) > Inventory (content type) > Products (content field), then a SearchUnify admin can connect Enable Auto Spell Correcter with Products. That's all it's needed for Did You Mean to recognize that 256-bit TLI is incorrect and fetch five extra search results on the first page with the correct query, 256-byte TLI. Expand Dictionary of In-House Terminology To the admins relief, once a connection has been established, Enable Auto Spell Corrector keeps expanding and updating the dictionary with each crawl of the content source. Turn On ""Enable Auto Spell Correcter"" Select a search client where auto boosting will be applied. To auto-pick a search client each time you navigate to Search Tuning, click to bookmark it. Toggle Enable Auto Spell Correcter to turn it on. Click to launch a window where you can select content sources. Select the content source, content type, and content fields and click Add.

15,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Virtual-Agent/Response-Type-Simple.htm,Get to Know Response Types: Simple,"Get to Know Virtual Agent Response Types: Simple The category Simple offers three response types: Text, External Link, and Pause. Let's understand them one at a time. Text Response Type Text response type is used when you want to convey information or ask something. It can be combined with other response types, such as Options. To use Text: Click Select Response Type. Select Text. In the section that has appeared, write a textual response in the empty field. OPTIONAL. Click to add another textual response. It's always a great idea to use more than one Texts. That way, the Virtual Agent can pick one at random to sound more natural. OPTIONAL. Select the entire or a part of the textual response and format it. You can bold, put into italics, underline, and/or insert links in text responses. OPTIONAL. Use to combine text response with other response types, such as Options. External Link External Link is useful when you want to direct users to a web page where they can read or watch a solution to their problem themselves. Inserting links in responses is straightforward. After you have selected an intent that will trigger the node, perform the following instructions. Click Add Response Type and select External Link from Simple. Enter the Label. The label functions as the anchor text. Instead of a link, the end users see the anchor text which can be up to 35 characters long. In Valid Hyperlink, enter the URL where the end user is going to be redirected to. Note. When a YouTube link is inserted in Valid Hyperlink, the video gets embedded right into the chat. Finally, on checking Open Link in New Tab, you ensure that all the embedded links don't interrupt the current chat sessions. Pause It seems mechanical when the virtual agent answers immediately after receiving user input. You can add a human touch to your virtual agent by introducing a Pause between two consecutive responses. During the Pause period, you can either display Bot is typing... or no message at all. It's recommended to display Bot is typing... to maintain engagement. In the default set-up, it is set to 5 seconds. Click Add Response Type and select Pause from Simple. You will see a slider, Duration. Use the slider to select a Pause period between 1 and 10 seconds. Alternatively, you can check Show Bot is tying... during Pause. Also, to delete the Pause interval, click Delete. NOTE. Don't add Pause to the last response. It'll impact user experience negatively. Add or Delete a Response on a Node An admin can insert multiple responses into a node. When business requirements change, the admin can add or delete a response. To add a response to an existing node, click Add a Response and remove an existing response, click . The function is at the extreme right of each response. Once you have made the changes, scroll up and Save them. Change Response Order A node can house two or more responses. In the default set-up, the latest response ends up on top. But you can change the default order. Use to drag responses up and down. Once you have made the changes, scroll up and Save them."
16,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Virtual-Agent/Story-Board.htm,Story Board,"Story Board and User Feedback The Story Board is where utterances, intents, and entities transform themselves into a functional bot. In the SearchUnify parlance, a story consists of nodes. You can connect several nodes to create a story. Node vs Intent Nodes were introduced with the Colubridae '21 release. They are separate from intents. Except for the first one, nodes aren't triggered by intents. A way to comprehend them is to consider a simple scenario. Assume that you want to give a user three ways to proceed when they show an interest in ""search clients."" The three ways are: Find which platforms can a search client be installed on, How to install a search client on a supported platform, and What configurations are available after installation. Intents are only used in the first node: to determine if a user is interested in search clients, and never again. An advantage separating nodes from intents is that once an intent has been detected, you can create really comprehensive stories around it rather fast. Compose a Story Go to Apps > Virtual Agent, and open a bot for editing. Switch to Story Board. An empty screen greets you when you open a bot for editing. To create a story, click Compose Story. A dialog with three fields will appear, of which the first two are mandatory. Name. The name of your story that you cannot change. It is not visible to instance users. Names consist of only letters and underscores. Label. The name of your story that can be changed anytime. It is visible to instance users. Names can contain any Unicode character. Description. A short summary of the story. Save the story. Click on the Start node. In the dialog that has opened, enter Node Name and Node Label. After that, pick a trigger in Select Intent. If none of the existing intents matches your story, you can use Create New Intent to write a trigger from scratch. NOTE: For a newly-created intent, utterances are added from the Intents section. An error is thrown when insufficient utterances are available. Configure Response. Once you have assigned a Name, Label, and Intent to a story, you can save settings and return anytime to configure responses. Alternatively, you can configure them immediately. Select Response Type offers several response types in four categories: Simple: Text, External Link, and Pause/Delay. For more information, check out: Get to Know Virtual Agent Response Types: Simple Selection: Option and Prompt. For details, check out Get to Know Virtual Agent Response Types: Selection Adapters: Connect to Live Agent and SU Adapter. For details, check out Get to Know Response Types: Adapters Action: Webhook. For details, check out Get to Know Response Types: Action A comprehensive story can have multiple nodes. You can view them all by either clicking Collapse on the left panel or zooming out through the Home button. User Feedback NOTE 1 User Feedback doesn't work on Salesforce legacy search clients. NOTE 2 Don't check Disable User Input. It inhibits User Feedback from functioning. Setting up a virtual agent is a start. Immediately after it goes live, you want to ensure that users are getting relevant answers. Digging through chat logs works in the early stages, when users are few, but this approach doesn't scale. Moreover, users never get to know how hard you are working to improve user experience. User Feedback offers a solution to both of these challenges. User Feedback asks users to rate conversations. The ratings are stored a report, where you can review them. It's more efficient than perusing through chat logs. From the users' perspective, a simple feedback question assures them that someone is really interested in helping them. They feel valued. Unlike many other features, User Feedback doesn't have to be configured. It's linked with the first node in each story and is turned on by default. You can turn it off by toggling User Feedback to the left. On the users' side, a feedback question—Did you find what you were looking for?—is displayed after conversations. The user can thumbs up () or thumbs down () their experience. When is clicked, the user gets the message: ""Thank you! We are glad that we could help."" On the other hand, when is clicked, the user sees a chatbot with the prompt ""Please elaborate your experience."" The user can add details or click Skip."
17,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Virtual-Agent/Tiles.htm,Virtual Agent Analytics Overview: Tiles,"Virtual Agent Analytics Overview: Tiles Analytics is available for all deployed virtual agents. It opens on the Overview tab which contains four tiles and two reports: Conversions and Intents. Total Sessions The number of search sessions in which virtual agent is consulted at least once. A user can converse with a chatbot multiple times in a session without increasing the Total Sessions count. Total Sessions increases only when user lands on a platform where SearchUnify is installed and launches the virtual agent at least once before the search session expires. Total Conversations Each instance of launching the virtual agent is a conversation. A user can click the virtual agent icon to start a conversation and later close the chat window. Because a search session can host more than one conversations, total conversations can be more than total sessions. Successful Conversations The total number of conversations that meet the criteria for success as defined in Settings. For instance, you can define success as those conversations in which the end-user leaves a feedback. Or, you can define successful as those conversations in which the end-user doesn't create a case and doesn't ask to be connected to a live agent. All the criteria and their usage can be found on Creative ways to measure virtual agent success. Coverage Coverage is the ratio of intents triggered to free utterances. A free utterance is a text input. Clicking on a link, selecting an option, or responding to a bot are all utterances but not free utterances. Only those utterances are free utterances in which a user inputs text that starts a new conversation and the bot looks for matching intents.

18,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Virtual-Agent/Train-Preview-Publish.htm,"Train Virtual Agent, Preview and Publish Changes","Train Virtual Agent, Preview and Publish Changes Training a bot is an ongoing process to ready a chatbot for better managing end-user interactions. In SearchUnify’s Virtual Agent the process is divided into three parts: Train, Preview, and Publish. In the first stage, you can devise a training model for the bot to help it understand the patterns of communicating with the users. Once the model is ready, you can Preview it to verify its accuracy and functionality, and once convinced Publish it. Train Bot Under the Story Board tab, there are other three options available other than Compose Story. After you have composed the stories for the virtual agent interactions, you can use the Train Bot option to train the chatbot. Based on the user utterances, the bot will identify the best-matched intent and also leverage bot memory detection to identify entities and drive prompt responses. Under the Story Board tab, click on the Train Bot option to initiate the training. Clicking Train Bot shows the progress of training on a scale of 0-100%. The bot is trained based on only the intents used in any of the stories. A message, Training Completed, is visible on your screen upon completion of the training. Any changes in Intents, Entities, or Storyboard sections are reflected on search client chatbot only after successful training and when changes are published on the search client. Preview Bot To see if everything is working as expected, you can use the Preview Bot option. This option enables admins to preview and test the chatbot changes before publishing those on the search client. Upon clicking Preview Bot, a pop-up window (divided into left and right sections) opens. The left section shows the chat conversation window and the right section will show additional information for each bot or user response. This preview works on the last trained data and it allows intent and bot memory detection. When the first response of any story is triggered due to the user's utterance in the left section, the right section shows the intent identified by the bot and show as an example 'Intent: Greeting' where Greeting is the name of intent. In the right section, the confidence rate for the identified intent is shown in the range from 0% to 100%. The system asks if the intent is correct . A user can choose between the other two intents that best match their utterance on negative feedback. The utterance is automatically added under the selected Intent. All an admin has to do is train the bot again for the newly added utterance to reflect it in the model. When a user responds, the system detects the value from the user's response. The bot memory variable or entity extracted from the user's response is shown in the right section. For example 'Type: Content Source' where Type is the name of the variable and Content Source is the response received from the user. After completing the preview, you can make the edits stories or go ahead with publishing. Publish Bot After you have successfully trained the bot and are certain that the training was successful, you can go ahead and click Publish. The changes reflect on the bot on production after you click Publish."

They act as a wall against the deluge of customer requests while still delivering exceptional user experiences. Most of the time, the chatbots work. For the exceptional scenarios, you can backstop the wall with human agents. This article is for support managers whose teams work in Zendesk Chat and who have also set up a SearchUnify chatbot on their community, website, or another customer-facing platform. In this article, they can learn how to ensure a smooth handoff to an agent working in Zendesk Chat when the chatbot falters in the face of a complex query or the user has a preference for carbon-based intelligence over a silicon-based one. Prerequisites It's been assumed that you already have: A chatbot set up; or at least one story in Conversation Moved to Colubridae '20 or a newer version of SearchUnify Obtain Account Key and Activate Zendesk Adapter Configure the Handoff Go to Virtual Agent from main navigation. Click to view chatbot settings. In Conversation, open a story for editing. From If Bot Recognizes, select the intent in response to which the handoff will be triggered. SuggestionCreate an intent exclusively for handover. In most chatbots, that intent will be named Out of Scope, Handover to Zendesk, or something along those lines. Start writing a response. From the Response Type dropdown, select Options. In the Enter Title field, write a message that will be displayed in the chat window right above the message prompting the user to connect to an agent. What happens when no agent is available during the handoff? When a handoff is initiated during off hours, or at a time when no agent is available, the chatbot returns an apology. The content of the apology message is managed in Zendesk. Because handoff is an Option, the response will be in the form of a button. Enter a label for the button (1) and select Zendesk Live Agent from dropdown (2). OPTIONAL. Insert more responses. Save your settings. Now whenever your chatbot will encounter the intent selected in step 4, it will initiate the handoff process. During the process, the entire conversation between the chatbot and the user will be forwarded to one of your agents (section highlighted yellow in the image in Result), who can then skim through the conversation and learn about the issue before accepting the chat request or transferring it to a colleague.

26,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Search-Clients/Permissions-Override.htm,Permissions Override,"Enable Search of Access Controlled Documents with Permissions Override Some content sources—such as Salesforce and Google Drive—enable admins to limit access to files based on user type. SearchUnify recognizes such access control settings and applies them to search clients with the consequence that a user who cannot access a Salesforce report in your org, cannot find it through search too. But this default setting has a drawback. Your search client is rarely the user who is allowed to access documents. It means that your gated content source will not display in the search client until default permissions are bypassed. Permissions Override bypasses default access control permissions to enable your search client to fetch results. Turn on Permissions Override In order to override access control settings for a content source, navigate to Content Sources screen and toggle the Permissions Override switch to the right."

Each metric has its own tile where you can view approximate numbers, such as Unique Successful Searches: 11K and Searches with No Result: 7K. On hovering over a tile, the exact numbers appear, such as Unique Successful Searches: 11232 and Searches with No Result 7321. Tiles Searches with No Clicks The total number of searches in which user doesn't click on any result. The only scenario in which a no-click search occurs is when a user finds results in response to a query but doesn't click on any result. A second metric on the tile is Sessions with No Click. It is the total number of sessions in which there was at least one search with no click. Searches with No Result The total number of searches for which no result is returned. A search can be no-result for multiple reasons: Documents with the searched queries do not exist in your data repositories. The searcher does not have the permission to see documents. The search client is not connected with the content source where the documents are stored. Based on this information, content managers can select the best course of action to plug content gaps: Create new articles or educate users about advanced search. A second metric on the tile is Sessions with No Result. It is the total number of sessions in which there was at least one search with no result. Session with Unsuccessful Searches This counts the number of sessions where at least one unsuccessful search was recorded.

33,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/FAQs/Query-Building.htm,How Queries Are Transformed During Search,"How Queries Are Transformed During Search The article on crawling and indexing showed that instead of searching through a content source, SearchUnify matches a query with the data stored in its index, which is a highly-processed and simplified snapshot of the data on content sources. This article continues on the theme. Here you will learn how queries are transformed before their matching with a document from the index. Overview In the previous section we learned that when a user runs a query SearchUnify searches through its index instead of entire content sources. But how exactly does it find relevant documents? This is a story in itself. Operator Extraction Search parameters are reserved keywords which refine a query. SearchUnify supports three Boolean parameters. Boolean Operators: This is performed with # followed by search terms along with operators: AND: Finds documents which contain all words separated by AND or && in search query. This is equivalent to an intersection using sets. ‘# laptop AND charger’ finds results containing both laptop and charger. OR: Finds documents which have at least one of the terms separated by OR in search query. ‘# laptop OR charger’ finds results containing either laptop or charger or both. NOT: Finds documents which do not have the keyword preceded by NOT. ‘# laptop NOT charger’ finds results containing laptop but not charger. Besides Boolean parameters, SearchUnify also supports grouping and wildcard search. Grouping: All operators mentioned above can be grouped using braces To search for laptops or printers of of HP, use (laptops OR printers) AND hp. Wildcard search: Matches documents that have fields matching a wildcard expression (not analyzed). Supported wildcards are: * matches any character sequence (including the empty one) ? matches any single character. This operator can have serious implications on performance of query. From Advanced Search Parameters The search parameters can also be inserted using the Advanced Search form available right under the search box. Four options are available. With the Exact Phrase: Find documents with the query as it is. Use them to find document containing a specific phrase, sentence, or sequence of terms, rather than sparse occurrences of the keywords throughout the index items. You can use a phrase match query syntax to find such index items. Phrase search is not case-sensitive. Without the Words: Find documents that don't have the specified keyword(s). With One or More Words: Find documents that have at last one keyword from the query. Results per Page: Change the number of results displayed on each page. Text Processing As soon as a search query is entered, the search terms are sent for processing, which involves: Correcting Misspellings. The language in which the query is made is identified, then the search terms are matched with a standard dictionary of that language and a custom SearchUnify dictionary to identify and correct misspelled words. Converting Search Terms to Lowercase. The corrected (and misspelled) terms are converted to lowercase, if their lowercase forms exist. For languages such as Japanese, Arabic, and Hindi, this process is skipped. Removing Stop Words. Articles, conjunctions, and other common terms with little meaning are removed from a search query. In a query like, how to install SearchUnify in ServiceNow?, only install, SearchUnify, and ServiceNow are kept. Applying Synonyms. A search for SSO fetches documents containing single sign-on as well. SearchUnify has inbuilt support for standard synonyms (such as ""kill"", ""halt"", and ""abort"" in ""kill a process"", ""halt a process"", and ""abort a process""). Admins can further Synonyms to Improve Search Experience. Stemming Search Terms. A search for integration returns documents containing integration, integrate, integrating, and integrated as well. Users can enclose search terms between quotes to stop stemming. Query Building The processed search query has to be transformed into a form comprehensible to search algorithms. The transformation involves appending the search query with parameters that limit the scope of the search and generate results faster. Some parameters (resultsPerPage and uid) are common across search clients, but others are not. For example, the parameter permissions is available only for Salesforce search clients. This table lists the parameters that are frequently used for query building. Parameter Significance resultsFrom Search results offset function. If resultsFrom=x, then the first x results will be eliminated. The x+1th result will be the first result. sortby It can have one of these two values: score and post_time. Most relevant documents are displayed first if sortby=score. Conversely, the most recent documents are displayed on top if sortby=post_time. orderBy It's always set to descending.

34,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/FAQs/Search-Analytics.htm,Search-Analytics FAQ,"Search Analytics FAQ Why is a keyword in both Top Searches With Result and Searches With No Result? It can happen because of two reasons: Users are searching for locked-in data without signing in. Access control settings prevent some users from viewing some data. Users are employing facets and/or advanced search features. Is there a report to capture clicks on a PDF file? Any click on a PDF file is reflected in Conversions. Why is a keyword in Searches With No Result when it has several document matches? Two potential reasons: An overuse of facets and advanced search features can cause document, that's usually on the top for a keyword X, to disappear from search results altogether. You can confirm this hypothesis in the Mamba 20 Searches With No Result report, which captures the context of search as well. The content source with the right document was being crawled when a user ran the search. How can I see what filters were in use when a keyword was searched? Go to Search Analytics > Overview > Search Report > Search Classifications > Search With No Result and click on any number in the Sessions column. What is Successive Searches with Clicks in Content Gap Analysis? Two reports in the Content Gap Analysis section have the Successive Searches with Clicks panel: Searches with No Clicks and Searches with No Result. Searches with No Clicks A user looked up keyword_1. There were results but no document was clicked open. Then the same user employed ran a search for keyword_2 and this time clicked on a result. keyword_2 will be in the Successive Searches with Clicks panel. In case a user runs through several searches, such has keyword_1, keyword_2, keyword_3... but clicks a document only after searching for keyword_n, then only the keyword_n will be captured in Successive Searches with Clicks. Searches with No Result Same as Searches with No Clicks. What is the difference between Views and Clicks? Views. It includes all the pages visited by the user while browsing your website. Clicks. It includes only the search results (links) which were opened by the users. What is a conversion? A conversion is a click. How is the Session Tracking report useful? The Session Tracking report enables you to Select top searched keywords and study user behavior (content gaps, related searches, case creation, and popular content). Peruse the behavior of premium customers to understand their needs and assess their account health. Monitor how upgrades and announcements influence user activity. What determines the order of these results when there is no search keyword? The order of results is on the basis of number of most visited results. Why is there sometimes a discrepancy in total cases created? It usually happens when a session starts on Day 1 and lasts into Day 2. Take the following example: A session starts at 11 p.m. on January 20 and ends at 1 a.m. on January 21. During the session, a user creates a case at 11:30 p.m. Now, according to the session tracking report, the case was created on January 21 because the session ended on January 21. But the total cases report will show that no case was created on January 21, because it was actually created at 11:30 p.m. on January 20. Why are the numbers on Home in Analytics 1.0 and 2.0 different? The numbers on Analytics 1.0 and 2.0 are different when the date range on Analytics 2.0 is other than the past week. It is because the reports on Home in Analytics 1.0 always display the past week's data. The numbers don't change despite selecting a different date range. It was a bug and it has been fixed in Analytics 2.0. When you select a custom date range in Analytics 2.0, the numbers are displayed for the selected time. When is the right time to run the Searches With No Results report for a month? A week after the month, for which you want the numbers, has ended. If you want the Searches With No Results report for September, then run it on October 7 or later. Doing otherwise can produce reports with incorrect numbers. We are working on reducing this time period from a week to a day. Last updated: Wednesday, March 30, 2022 Was this article helpful? Send us your review at help-feedback@searchunify.com"

37,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/NLP-Manager/NLP-Manager.htm,NLP Manager,"NLP Manager This section lets you add Natural Language Processing functionality to your search clients. How smart would it be if your search client gives suggestions for misspelled queries, and not just grammatically correct suggestions, but also the ones that make sense in your specific business context? NLP Manager on SearchUnify Help Docs figures out the brand name and corrects the query “srchunifi” to “SearchUnify” instead of a “search” and “unify” -- two perfectly valid English words. Or, if you host a documentation center, your search client knows on its own that when users look up ‘languages’, they mean ‘computer languages’. NLP Manager Use NLP Manager to train your search client to parse sentences and recognize synonyms using Add Synonyms. Did You Mean Use Did You Mean to provide ‘did you mean’ suggestions when a user misspells a keyword. Suggestion Removal Suggestion Removal is used at times when an admin might want to turn off ‘did you mean’ suggestions for certain keywords. Manage Stopwords Manage Stopwords enables you to create a list of words that are removed from search queries before their processing. Articles, conjunctions, pronouns, and/or other grammatical particles can be removed using this feature so that they do not impact search results.

38,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Release-Notes/Colubridae-20-Release-Notes.htm,Colubridae ‘20 Release Notes,"Skip To Main Content Account Settings Logout placeholder Account Settings Logout Filter: All Files Submit Search Account Settings Logout You are here: Colubridae ‘20 Release Notes Bots have come of age in Colubridae ‘20 and they are everywhere now — from one bot for each SearchUnify instance to one bot for each search client. They are the stars of this release along with Community Helper and Search Analytics. The first is an entire support team wrapped into an addon. Once set up, it transforms even inactive forums into thriving communities. In the latter, data gathering capabilities have been expanded six times and a host of new reports have been introduced to the delight of data crunchers. Admins will find out-of-the-box support for two new content sources and three new search clients. Business owners can now serve in most locales with a reincarnated “Did You Mean”, which corrects misspelled search queries in more than 20 languages. For end users, Colubridae ‘20 brings facet search. A summary of all the new features and updates follows. Release Notes Colubridae ‘20 will start rolling out to SearchUnify customers in May. All updates-related queries can be directed to support@searchunify.com. Home Live-streaming of data in Recent Searches makes life easier for admins. Enhancements Autorefresh in Recent Searches Recent Searches provides real-time data on trending queries. It was always a nifty way for admins to stay on top of what was being searched. Now it has become better. An admin can find real-time data on search queries in Recent Searches, just as it was in Live Stream Search, without ever having to refresh their tab. Content Sources Higher Logic and SkillJar are now supported. Colubridae ‘20 also expands Salesforce capabilities to be able to index article drafts and record types. What’s New? Higher Logic Promote your community across all your platforms. SearchUnify can now index the user profiles, discussions, blogs, events, libraries, and other elements of your Higher Logic community, and make them searchable from virtually all your organizational platforms, including your knowledge base, website, and other platforms. More information: Use Higher Logic as a Content Source SkillJar Index all your educational content and access it from anywhere with a new connector for SkillJar. SearchUnify can index all your SkillJar courses. More information: Use Skilljar as a Content Source Enhancements Content API In the pre-Colubridae ‘20 times, an admin wanting to crawl a content source through Content API could verify his identity through a basic authentication method which involved entering the content source URL. It was quick, now it has been updated for security. OAuth 1.0 is available as a second way to authenticate your Content API content source. More information: Set up a Content Source with API Search Salesforce Article Drafts The articles published on a Salesforce Knowledge org tend to be vetted by several people; including the support rep who drafted it, the technical writer who wrote it, and the SME who checked it for accuracy. And they were searchable by anyone who had the right set of permissions. Now, this searchability has come to article drafts as well. Support reps or internal users creating the first draft can utilize search to be sure that they are not engaged in duplicate work. Learn more: Use Salesforce As a Content Source Record Fields Indexing for Lightning When Salesforce unveiled Lightning, article type objects were replaced with a vaster record type. While many organizations have kept their knowledge base in article types, others have moved to record types. It’s to the delight of the latter that Colubridae ‘20 introduces the capability to index record types. Irrespective of your org, Classic or Lightning, you can index your knowledge base. Search Clients SearchUnify can now be installed on Higher Logic, AEM, and SharePoint. The “Exclude” function has become language agnostic and end users can now search facets. Besides there is a new design for the Salesforce console search client. What’s New? Higher Logic Search on Higher Logic makes your community a one-stop-shop for content discovery by integrating all of your content repositories with out-of-the-box connectors. Installing the search client is easy and the data gathering capabilities of SearchUnify enable you to come up with winning strategies. As if that wasn’t enough, you can also set up a chatbot on the community. More information: Install a Search Client in Higher Logic AEM Increase the real-time findability of your AEM digital assets with SearchUnify intelligent search, which delivers the right experience to the right user and provides customers and prospects easier access to your content. with SearchUnify intelligent search. SharePoint At times, searching for a long-lost fine on SharePoint can be more difficult than surfing the dark web. Not any longer. A new search client for SharePoint will not only keep all your websites, folders, and documents a search away, but empower you to explore all your content sources without exiting SharePoint. Enhancements Unicode Support Comes to “Exclude” Exclude is a neat little feature that enables admins to configure facets. If an admin wants to remove a tag value, let’s assume “python”, from facets then all he has to do is to insert “python” into Exclude. The feature worked well as long as the value consisted of either numbers or the Basic Latin character set. Colubridae ‘20 changes that. Exclude now accepts values in most writing systems, including Hanzi, Kana, Cyrillic, and Hangeul. More information: Exclude Facet Values from Content Fields Find Facets to Apply Facets are handy but not when their numbers run into the dozens, hundreds, or even thousands. Imagine a large community. The tag facet can easily contain over 10,000 terms. Although admins can use Merge Facets to categorize these values, after a certain time even it seems like a fool’s errand. Call Facet Search to the rescue. Once set up, it puts a tiny search bar in a facet box, enabling end users to quickly find a facet value even if it’s not visible; the count is decided by an admin. More information: Advanced Search Tips: Find Facets New Design for Salesforce Console The search client installed in Salesforce Console has undergone a makeover. It’s now very similar to core Salesforce features both externally and internally. Main UI changes include: Brand new color theme to make the addon indistinguishable from native Salesforce components Smaller, readable typography so that a rep can find four results above the fold Copy to Clipboard and other buttons remain legible even on small screens Virtual Agent Chatbots have had a major upgrade. They now support custom slots and webhooks, analyze search data to find utterances, and accept the data stored in system entities. Anticipating that you will love them so much that you will want to use more of them, the earlier limit of one chatbot per instance has been abolished as well. What’s New? Create a Case on Salesforce from the Chat Window What happens when a customer cannot find a satisfactory answer from the chatbot? Mamba ‘20 introduced a Salesforce adapter, which enables customers to connect with live agents, working in Salesforce Console, without leaving the chat window. This release goes a step further. On top of chatting with agents, customers can now log a case straight from the chat window. More information: Set up case creation in conversation design Custom Slots and Webhooks The chatbot now supports one of the coolest features in the industry: slots. This new feature enables the bot to interpret user queries and answer intelligently. Webhooks draw on the power of your existing platforms to do some really exciting things, such as logging a case from the chat window. More information: Insert Custom Slots in Responses Improve Conversations Zendesk Connector A new connector makes it quick for users to talk with your agents on Zendesk. The connector is for users who need more information than a bot can provide. It would enable your customers to connect with your support agents right from the chatbot window. Enhancements Write New Stories with System Entities Entities are a group of related terms. For instance, case IDs can be grouped into one entity, CASEID, all customer names can be put into one class, CUSTOMERS. Admins could always define their own entities, but now they can also import entities—such as emails, phone numbers, and URLs—from their systems to expedite chatbot story development. More information: Create Entities Utterances and Intents from Search Queries Your chatbot now analyses search data, groups similar queries, and suggests intents. As an admin, you can add the suggested intents to your database. If you don’t like a suggestion, dismissal is a click away. Automated analysis saves much manual work that goes into mining intents from Search Analytics data and grouping them into an intent. More information: Add Intents and Utterances Multiple Chatbot Agents The old limit of one chatbot per instance has been scraped. You can now set up one chatbot for each search client. It means more personalized services across all your platforms. More information: Set up your first chatbot agent Search Analytics With two new reports—Case Creation and KCS Usage Statistics—search analytics has expanded. But it’s not just the expanse, but also the depth that matters and that side has been covered as well. Colubridae ‘20 can now process and display six month’s data simultaneously, enables admins to download and email all reports, and provides superior session tracking capabilities. What’s New? Case Creation Report A Salesforce-specific report to capture the cases logged on your Salesforce community along with the case IDs and case titles. Five of the report’s six columns are searchable to enable to quickly figure out who created a case, in which session, and what else the user did. More information: Case Creation Report in Overview Track the Usefulness of KCS-Generated Content The pre-Colubridae ‘20 version of KCS Report tracks production statistics. A quick view of the report told you how many articles were created on a case. KCS Usage Statistics goes a step further. It lists the most prolific writers in the support team and monitors how useful those KCS-generated articles have been by tracking how many KCS-generated articles were attached to cases and shared by agents. Find Reports that Matter to You The sheer number of reports in analytics can be overwhelming, especially if you are new to SearchUnify. Bundling makes life easier. If you are a Community Manager, Support Manager, or Content Manager, then you can check your profile and all the reports that you might find useful will start gathering data. You can, of course, edit the list by adding or removing reports. More information: Turn on Search Analytics Enhancements Data: The More the Merrier Colubridae ‘20 is capable of displaying more data. An admin can view up to 6 months’ of data using the Date Range filter— from only 30 days in Mamba ‘20. This alone is a convincing reason to upgrade if you are looking to discover hidden patterns in search use and, based on the insights, develop a long-term strategy to assist your employees and customers faster and more efficiently. More information: Check out Search Analytics Craft to Data Powered Stories in Session Tracking Data can only be used as a tool to the extent it is capable of undergoing analysis and telling stories. A 10GB data dump is nowhere as useful as a 500KB list of the 100 most popular keywords in your community. New filters in the ‘Sessions Tracking’ report enable admins to craft their own stories. They can turn on the ‘Searches’ filter to view Search Sessions and turn it off to view No Search Sessions. Or they can combine it with another filter, let’s say ‘Cases’, to find No Search Sessions that led to a case being logged. Or they can quickly discover many sessions a user created by looking up its email address or find a session quickly by searching its ID. With the tools provided in Colubridae ‘20, the number of stories that can be crafted is pretty much infinite. Identify Articles that Failed to Deflect Cases When issues occur, which they always do, documentation can help users fix them. It’s only when documentation fails in some way that customers turn to support. The new ‘Failed to Deflect Cases’ report captures the weakest links in your documentation: the articles were consulted before the customer logged a case and the sessions in which those articles were consulted and entire session activity. Based on this data, you can prioritize rewriting. View More Details in Articles that Deflected Cases Discover the real heroes, the gems in your knowledge base with a revamped Articles that Deflected Cases report. As the name suggests, it is here that you will find all the documents, that after consulting, customers never felt the need to talk to support or log a ticket. These are the articles that can be boosted to improve overall search experience. Download and Email Reports The download and email feature has been extended to all reports. You can download any report for further perusal in a data analysis tool of your choice. As for sharing, the email field now accepts comma separated emails, enabling you to send a report to multiple people simultaneously. More information on Download and Share an Analytics Report Search Tuning Auto Tuning has grown nimbler to detect even minute changes in search client usage and a new parameter enables admins to boost articles attached to Salesforce cases. What’s New? Boost Articles Attached to Salesforce Cases Capitalize on the collective judgement of the support reps with Salesforce Articles (Attached to Case) in Custom Boosting. The idea is simple. If you think that your agents would attach only those articles to cases that they deem useful, then you can give a rank boost to those agent-vetted articles. More Information: Custom Tune Search Results NLP Manager Query corrections in multiple languages, guaranteed results on each suggestion, and synonym recognition are the highlights of NLP Manager in this release. Enhancements Konnichi wa Did You Mean SearchUnify could always detect misspelled words and suggest alternatives as long as the search queries were in English. It has changed. Now it can correct こんにちわ to こんにちは (Japanese for “Hello”) and dooté to douté (French for “doubted”) and здраствуйте to здравствуйте (Russian for “Hello”). To put it another way, Did You Mean now works for all major languages, which include French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Italian, Chinese, and Korean. More information: Try out the new Unicode-compliant Did You Mean Did You Mean Guarantees Results You can have your cake and eat it too. The anguishing choice between Custom Dictionary and Standard Dictionary has been replaced with a pleasant default that brings you the best of both. Did You Mean is now powered by your content sources, which means each suggestion guarantees at least one result. All the same time, it remains connected to a standard dictionary to ensure that Did You Mean is triggered only when the search query is nonstandard. “klient” triggers Did You Mean but “kamikaze” doesn’t. More information: Providing Useful Suggestions through Did You Mean Did You Mean Recognizes Synonyms Most organizations have in-house jargon and it usually falls on the person managing information retrieval to strike a balance between the jargon and terms more commonly understood. A common such term is int, which all programmers know stands for an integer. But people who don’t spend their entire working days writing code, might not immediately decrypt and probably never search this three letter mystery. SearchUnify has long provided a solution in Synonyms Manager. Once an admin sets int and integer to synonyms, then a search for either keywords brings about the same results. In this release, the solution has gotten a little better. Did You Mean now recognizes uncommon synonyms and doesn’t correct int to “ant”, “end” or anything less useful. More information: Add Synonyms and Did You Mean Addons The SearchUnify app store has a new addon, Community Helper. What’s New? Be Active on Community 24x7 If we had a Feature of the Release award, it would have gone to Community Helper. Installing this addon and configuring it will have the same impact on your community as hiring an entire team. Once set up, it stays in the background and keeps looking out for unanswered threads. Once it finds a thread that hasn't been answered during a specified interval (which an admin decides), it responds to the original poster. An admin can configure response templates with placeholders. Built-in AI ensures that the correct template is fired all the time. More information: Set up Community Helper LIST OF UPDATED FEATURES.

This release brings significant updates in both the core platform and SearchUnify applications. The core platform has been strengthened with faster search engines, introduction of a Super Admin, new search analytics reports, and regex support in Keyword Tuning. Also in the core platform, Addons have been renamed to Apps and the content sources have been organized into categories and a new Synonyms 3.0 in NLP Manager offers more relevant suggestions to admins. The applications ecosystem has been expanded as well. A new app flags the tickets more likely to turn into an escalation. You can read more about it in Escalation Prediction. Another app, Virtual Agent, can now assist your customers in Spanish, crack jokes in French, and talk about the universe in Russian. Onboarding and story building in virtual agents has been tidied up as well. Now setting up a new agent is a matter of minutes. Release Schedule Mamba '21 will start rolling out to customers in the last week of November. All updates-related queries can be directed to support@searchunify.com Core Platform The updates the core platform concern content sources, search clients, search analytics, search tuning, NLP manager, user management, and the home screen. 1. Home A slicker navigation awaits you in Mamba '21. It's shorter and customizable. New Navigation You get more features in less space this time. The number of text buttons has been culled. The almost 50% leaner menu is so easy to scan that you can find any feature without ever scrolling. Instead of being spilled all over the navigation, the Apps (previously Addons) have been grouped. When you need one, click to find them all. To install a new App, click the text button instead of . Knowledge Graph has been moved to Apps as well and Asset Library to Search Clients. As Security, Manage Users, and Alerts, each has found a new home in Administration. Besides the new navigation has been designed after observing current usage behavior, where Moderators and Admins engage more frequently with tuning, analytics, and content source and search client configurations than adding or removing users, which happens to be a one-off affair. More information: Getting to Know Your SearchUnify Dashboard One Absolutely Improved Home Screen A massive design job on the Home Screen overturns the reports' position, improves aesthetics, and guarantees an overall smoother behavior in general. Instead of a toggle, a new switch can make the navigation panel appear or disappear. Live Search Stream has jumped to the top and other reports have been clubbed for similarity. 2. Content Sources A new design, version support for documents, and capability to index all translated Salesforce Knowledge articles at once make indexing more powerful. What's New Find Content Sources Faster No more the proverbial search for a needle in the haystack. Instead of endless scrolling, you can now find a content source from the search box or one of the seven categories introduced in this release: Popular, Cloud Storage, Collaboration, Content Management System, CRM, Learning Management System, Search Engine, and Others. Each content source tile now shows four pieces of information, two buttons (Add and Know More) and two icons. Click Add to proceed with indexing and Know More to access official documentation around that content source. shows that the content source has already been installed and stands for a newly-introduced content source. More information: Find Content Sources Quickly Enhancements Index all Translated Salesforce Knowledge Articles Simultaneously This feature could be of particular interest to Salesforce CMS teams. Indexing all the articles in your multilingual Salesforce knowledge base is merely a matter of selecting content languages on the Authentication screen and indexing article IDs. SearchUnify takes care of the rest. More information: Use Salesforce As a Content Source Discover When A Document Was Last Crawled You could always view the crawled documents by clicking their number in the Total Documents column. Starting from Mamba '21, you can also view the time they were indexed. The new column comes with the added advantage of showing if a certain doc was added in the last crawl or not. The complete list can be shared over an email. More information: View and Delete Indexed Data with Total Documents More Information on the Content Sources Screen The content sources screen now offers two new columns: Last Sync and Status. The Last Sync column lists the time when the content source was updated. The Status column offers three values: Successful. The content source has been successfully indexed. In Progress. The content source is being crawled. Failed. The previous attempt to index was not successful. New. The content source has been recently added and needs a manual crawl. The Type column has gotten an update as well. Hovering the mouse over any icon reveals the content source. More information: Get More Information on Crawling in New Status Column 3. Search Clients Two result views for website clients, a concise screen for editing Content Sources, and an improved Salesforce Console client awaits you in Mamba '21. What's New Get all Versions in One Result (Beta) Multiple versions of a document are now more accessible. A little dropdown on the search results page lists all the available versions, with the latest and most relevant one being served first. SearchUnify Users can set up the criterion used for versioning. For instance, the documents grouped on the basis of ""Published Date"" can be filtered on the basis of date and the documents put together on the basis of ""Version Number"" can be found by the number. This feature solves two problems at once: A search user can immediately find all versions and there are almost no duplicates in results. More information: Merge Multiple Versions of a Doc into One Result Tile View on Search Results Page This feature could be of special interest to teams using Salesforce Service Console. This one is huge for those who have gotten bored of the default view in which results are stacked on one another. Moderators and Admins can now configure the search results page to capture more AND diverse information. All the relevant results from all the content sources can be shown on one search results page. Tile View has some advantages. The biggest being that it works great on new search clients where there is little search relevance data. Once users demonstrate their preferences, then Admins can switch to the default view. Tile View is currently supported on Salesforce Console, Salesforce Internal, and Website search clients. More information: Customize Search Client Results View Enhancements Brand New Content Source Edit Screen The entire screen has been redesigned. It looks better on small screens. Two major changes are the appearance of a Choose Icon button and the disappearance of the Content Type column. The latter has been subsumed. To view Content Type, click on any Content Source. As for the Choose Icon button, it allows you to connect thumbnails to content types. Choose Icon is essentially Asset Library moved onto this screen. More information: Help Users Distinguish Content Sources on Results Page with Icons or Thumbnails Recently Viewed Docs This one is for search client users, who can view the already consulted documents in different colors. Search Client Preview Allow users to view a page without really opening it. Works on desktops and mobiles — as long as the result and the search client share a domain or the results are on YouTube or Vimeo. For example, it works only when the document is hosted on xyz.com/article and the search client on xyz.com/search. The preview mechanism is useful for those Admins who don't want search users to navigate to newer tabs very often and leave their platform to view documents. More information: Basic Search Client Configurations Advanced Features in Create Formula This release transforms Create Formula from a basic access control tool to a complete powerhouse which lets you write new formulae, control indexing jobs, and filter search results based on practically all the available content types and content fields, such as Salesforce User IDs. 4. Search Analytics To the delight of all data nerds, three new reports and a reincarnated Search Filter Sessions await you in Mamba '21. What's New New Report to Measure Search Experience Average Click Position is part of SearchUnify's mission to create applications that assist you to measure search relevance. The underlying idea is straightforward. If a lot of your search client users are navigating to page 2, page 3 or beyond to find the documents they need, then the search experience is not all that great. But if Average Click Position improves over time, let's say, from 8 to 3, then that means the search relevance models are learning at the back-end and providing more relevant results to search users. This report tells you where exactly those people are clicking. Then, it's upon you to take corrective actions. More information: Average Click Position Search Experience Details in Click Position Report The devil is in the details and the details on the search experience are in Click Position Report, which unlike its sibling, Average Click Position, shows search experience for each keyword. Average Click Position tells you that search client users frequently click the results on position 5. Click Position Report furnishes details. The average click position for keyword ""X"" is 7 and for keyword ""Y"" is 3. Using this report, you can learn what documents need boosting and for what keywords. More information: Click Position Report Cumulative Case Deflection Formula Admins with case management might want to check out this update first. The Cumulative Case Deflection Formula captures more faithfully the role of content in assisting users. The formula monitors deflections from stage 1 and stage 2 to provide a complete picture, that is deflection from search. When Salesforce Knowledge articles are used as direct articles, it can count how many cases are deflected from knowledge articles, irrespective of whether a user found them through search, a saved bookmark, a click on the home page, or an email. More information: Explore How Case Deflection Works Case Deflection Trend Chart A brand new chart in Conversions shows, against a ruled background, three metrics any support manager would like to have on their tips: Total Sessions, Deflected Sessions, and Case Deflections. The support manager can view these metrics' evolution over a desired period (Date Range) and on one or all search clients (Select Search Client). The metrics are captured for Stage 1, Stage 2, and both Stage 1 and 2 (Cumulative). The visual chart is extremely useful for tracking variation. Any steep rise or precipitous fall might demand immediate involvement. An advantage of viewing the report is to view key metrics in visual form. More information: Case Deflection Trend Chart Enhancements Quick Filters in Sessions Tracking Report To reduce repeat work, Search Tracking Details offers a new feature, Quick Filters. For instance, if you want to find the sessions in which content failed at deflection and a case was logged, simply check a Quick Filter. In the old fashioned way, it takes several clicks in the Filter By Report menu. The five options generate most frequently-called reports. More information: Session Tracking Details New Page No. Column in Session Tracking Details The new column shows which page a particular result was clicked on. More information: Session Tracking Details Shorter, Simpler Name for an Activity Type Field Don't be taken away the next time you download a Session Tracking Details report and don't find the field ""Text Searched (Community Page)."" It has been renamed to much simpler ""Text Searched."" More information: Session Tracking Details Four Download Configurations in Session Tracking Details Before downloading or sharing this report, you can define the time stamps and select an Activity Count format. The choice is between YYYY-MM-DD and YYYY-MM-DD + TIME for time stamps. As for Activity Count, retain the old format in which the total number of searches, clicks, and cases are tagged with each activity or switch to the new format which uses Boolean numbers to convey the same information. More information: Download and Share an Analytics Report Intuitive Search Summary Chart Search Summary report has received an under-the-hood update. Instead of capturing the data for the subsequent period, each data point shows the data for the previous period. The new design is more intuitive. More information: Search Summary Redefined Unique Clicks Under the hood, the unique clicks count recording algorithm has been improved to be more in line with how current SearchUnify Moderators and Admin perceive unique clicks. For instance, a user searching ""x"" and clicking results 1, 3, and 4 constitute one unique click. Also, another user searching ""y"", clicking a result, applying a facet, and then again clicking another result also constitute one unique click. More information: Unique Searches in Overview 5. Search Tuning The biggest change in the support for regular expressions in Keyword Tuning. Custom Tuning has been updated as well. What's New Regex Based Tuning Support for regular expressions combines the simplicity of query boosting with the power of regex. Keyword Tuning works just like before, except for power users who get to choose how comprehensive they want to be. Here is a real world example. A document boosted to rank one for ""API"" doesn't automatically turn at the top for its plural sibling, ""APIs"". To boost the doc for both, an admin enters two separate queries separately. Regex saves the day in such scenarios. Instead of entering multiple separate keywords, an admin can boost any document for the pattern /apis?/i , which covers both ""API"" and ""APIs"". Regex can be intimidating for newbies, so the UI has been revamped to make the screen more enticing. More information: Boost Documents for Specific Keywords Enhancements Custom Tuning Based on Search Clients Click Boosting Rate in Custom Tuning comes with two options rolled into one. What that means is, you can configure how the clicks are counted. Stick with the default setting to gather clicks from all the search clients, thereby allowing documents receiving the most clicks to rise quickly in search results. Turn off Include Clicks from All Search Clients to limit the impact to one search client. Example. A document D has a score 10 for a keyword K. More information: Custom Tuning: Boost Articles Based on Keyword Match in a Field 6. NLP Manager The only change in NLP Manager is under-the-hood. The automatic synonyms suggestions have gotten better. Synonyms 3.0 for Smarter Synonyms and Acronyms Although there are no UI changes in Synonym Suggestions, underneath the code has been completely rewritten to take advantage of the latest developments in AI. After switching over to Mamba '21, you will notice that the suggestions for synonyms and acronyms are more context relevant. More information: Add Synonyms to Improve Search Experience Administration The biggest update is the introduction of Super Admin. Other changes include serving Account Details and result previews on search clients. What's New Be in Control with Super Admin Rights Instead of two, there are now three sets of users: moderators, admins, and one super admin.

Prevent Escalations Before They Occur An app for support managers using Salesforce for Case Management. Some support tickets are more likely to end up in an escalation than others. What are those? Escalation Prediction provides an answer. Based on a thorough analysis of your previous tickets, it identifies the factors that lead to an escalation. The factors could be a product, a certain demographic, or the time of logging. It can be the presence of certain terms or phrases in a ticket. The app finds them all and rates them on an escalation probability scale. You can then tackle the high-probability tickets before they turn into an escalation. More information: Set up Escalation Predictor to Preempt Tickets 3. Knowledge Graph Is an App Knowledge Graph has been moved to Apps. It works just as before.

Prerequisites Ensure that you have fulfilled the prerequisites before making your first call. 1. Set a user scope SearchUnify users can have one of these five scopes. Each scope has an impact on the calls a user can make. The instructions to change user scope are in Change User Scope. 2. Create an app At the time of creating an app, you obtain a client ID and client secret. Both are used to ascertain your identity. The process of creating an app has been explained in Get Client ID and Client Secret with an API App. 3. Obtain access and refresh tokens using the app Access and a refresh tokens are required to be able to use the Content API. The process of generating these tokens has been explained in Get Access and Refresh Token Using curl. Using Access and Refresh Tokens The token generation call produces two kinds of tokens: Refresh and Access. Refresh tokens don't expire until they are revoked by SearchUnify. Store them securely. The sole use of refresh tokens is to generate access tokens. Access tokens expire every four hours. They authenticate users. It is mandatory to include them in the header of your API calls. The format is -H ""authorization: Bearer {{access token}}"" . Base URL https://{{hostname}}/api/v2_cs/ The hostname is the URL of your SearchUnify instance.

48,https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/FAQs/Crawling-and-Indexing.htm,Crawling and Indexing Content Sources,"Crawling and Indexing Content Sources This article provides an overview of how SearchUnify crawls and indexes content sources. Overview The sole job of SearchUnify is to find information and it goes about it not the way most people imagine. Unlike CTRL+F, which matches a keyword with a text on a page, SearchUnify doesn't even bother to go through all documents on a content source each time a user searches. Instead, its rummages through its own bare-bones copy of each document, called an index. When you connect a Salesforce org, Khoros community, website, or another supported platform as a content source with your instance, SearchUnify finds all the documents stored on your content source, processes them, and creates a copy of them. The discovery job is crawling, processing is indexing, and the resultant copy is an index. Crawling is straightforward, it's indexing that demands engineering skills and lots of innovation and creativity. Consider these four crawled documents. D1. The Martians write about cats. D2. Natsume Soseki wrote a novel on cats. D3. My cat cannot write. D4. It's written in the book that cats are wild animals. Storing them as they are will be memory intensive. So SearchUnify breaks the text in each document into short strings, also known as tokens. Tokenization A really primitive way to create tokens is to use word boundaries. Despite being easy, it is seldom used because the tokens aren't always what we humans would want. ""Natsume Soseki"" in D2 is a writer. It's incorrect to part his name into two tokens. Ditto with ""wild animals"" in D4. D1. The | Martians | write | about | cats. D2. Natsume | Soseki | wrote | a | novel | on | cats. D3. My | cat | cannot | write. D4. It's | written | in | the | book | that | cats | are | wild | animals. And we haven't even considered languages such as Chinese, Japanese, or Thai where only sentence boundaries exist. D5. 北冥有魚其名為鯤。 A primitive tokenizer will find only one token in D5, when it has several. Consider its English translation, ""In the Northern Lake lives a fish whose name happens to be Kun."" SearchUnify's tokenizer is smarter. It can detect collocations and tokenize accordingly. Although the exact details are a trade secret, an approximate tokenization of the first four documents might resemble this. D1. The Martians | write | about cats. D2. Natsume Soseki | wrote | a novel | on cats. D3. My cat | cannot | write. D4. It's | written | in | the book | that | cats | are | wild animals. Conversion to Lowercase and Stopwords Removal Gustave Eiffel * born * Dijon, France * 1832 * become * architect * constructed * Eiffel Tower. Gustave Eiffel was born in Djion, France in 1832 and became an architect who constructed the Eiffel Tower. Those asterisks mar the sentence's beauty but they don't really hinder comprehension. They are placeholders for stopwords. During indexing, SearchUnify removes all stopwords, punctuation, and converts the tokens into lowercase. Our index might look like this. D1. martians | write | cats D2. natsume soseki | wrote | novel | cats D3. cat | cannot | write D4. written | book | cats | wild animals This technique has a few drawbacks, such as the handling of entire phrases made from stopwords, such as Shakespeare's ""To be or not to be."" and the eliminating the difference between ""us"" and ""the U.S."" Nonetheless, clever programmers can find a way to overcome these shortcomings. Stemming Are ""sing"" and ""sang"" two words or one? This isn't the musing of a ruminating philosopher on a far-off island, but something lexicographers and search engine designers have to grapple with. Their solutions is to group words into lexemes. read, reader, reading can all be put under the lexeme READ. D1. martian | write | cat D2. natsume soseki | write | novel | cat D3. cat | cannot | write D4. write | book | cat | wild animal The accuracy of stemming depends on language detection. It is relatively easy in English and Chinese. But in languages with rich morphology, such as German and Russian, stemmers can be extremely sophisticated pieces of engineering. A COMPUTER can be computer or computers in English. But in Russian KOMPYUTER can take 12 forms: kompyuter, kompyutera, kompyuteru, kompyuter, kompyuterom, o kompyutere, kompyutery, kompyuterov, kompyutery, kompyuteram, kompyuterami, o kompyuterah. Each noun in Russian is inflected in 12 ways, instead of 2 in English. Inverted Index Once the stemming is complete, the index is inverted. It means that instead of listing keywords for each document, SearchUnify lists documents for each keywords. Here's what an inverted index looks like. Keyword Occurance Document martian 1 D1 write 4 D1, D2, D3, D4 cat 4 D1, D2, D3, D4 natsume soseki 1 D2 novel 1 D2 cannot 1 D3 book 1 D4 wild animal 1 D4 When a user searches, SearchUnify finds documents in this index, not in the content source. A search for ""novel"" will return D3 and a search for ""wild animals"" D4. At this point, you might be thinking what will happen if someone were to search ""cat"" which is in all the four docs? Well, other factors come into pay in that scenario, such as the keyword's position and its field (title, tag or somewhere else), user permissions, and others which will be covered in the next section. For now, it's safe to assume that D3 will come up on top because cats is the first word in the document. Related How Queries Are Transformed During Search"

A blank window is a no-starter. KCS Enabler solves the problem by filling some fields, such as the title, case details, and a few document attributes. The app supports several templates. A SearchUnify admin can configure a separate template for each object in Classic and each record type in Lightning. Prerequisites A Salesforce Service Console search client that is connected with at least one Salesforce content source KCS set-up in Salesforce: Instructions are on Set up KCS in Salesforce Rich text fields appear in the search console only when they have been configured in Salesforce Install Go to Apps and open Install New App. Install KCS Support Console.

Go to Search Clients and open a Salesforce Service Console by clicking Navigate to KCS Support. Enable KCS Pick a Salesforce Experience from Classic or Lightning. Although the rest of the article demonstrates how to add a mapping with Classic, the steps for Lightning are identical, with a small exception: For Classic, the API for record and knowledge type are added separately. Click Add New Mapping. While adding a new mapping, you can customize article view for agents from Configure Article List View. The dropdown has two options: Agent's Own Draft Articles and All Draft Articles. The first is set by default and allows an agent to view only the drafts created by themselves. The second option lets them view the articles created by other agents as well. Enter the name of your Knowledge object in Article Object API Name. It is usually knowledge__kav. If the API Name is correct, all the object fields will be displayed. These knowledge objects could be custom knowledge objects as well. Each knowledge type object will represent a separate template for KCS to use in the service console for agents. Drag any article field to the highlighted space. Title and URLName mapping are mandatory but mapping of other fields depends on your business needs. A window will pop up. Drag a case field to the highlighted space. In the next diagram, the case field caseObject.Subject will autopopulate the article field Title. It means that the value in caseObject.Subject will be copied to Title. NOTE. You can use Enter Label to rename the mapped field to ""Heading"" or another term used inside your organization and pick a template from the Select Section dropdown.
